From the AP comes this story :
President Bush on Tuesday nominated two individuals to replace retiring jurists on federal courts in the Washington area .
Bush nominated Jennifer M. Anderson for a 15 - year term as associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia , replacing Steffen W. Graae .
***
Bush also nominated A. Noel Anketell Kramer for a 15 - year term as associate judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals , replacing John Montague Steadman .
The sheikh in wheel - chair has been attacked with a F - 16 - launched bomb .
He could be killed years ago and the israelians have all the reasons , since he founded and he is the spiritual leader of Hamas , but they did n't .
Today 's incident proves that Sharon has lost his patience and his hope in peace .
Nervous people make mistakes , so I suppose there will be a wave of succesfull arab attacks .
A la guerre c'est comme a la guerre !
In the eastern city of Baqubah , guerrillas detonated a car bomb outside a police station , killing several people .
The US lost yet another helicopter to hostile fire near Habbaniyah in the Sunni heartland , but this time the crew was safe .
In Fallujah , hundreds of demonstrators came out against US troops when they briefly arrested a yound newlywed bride .
( I hope that the US army got an enormous amount of information from her relatives , because otherwise this move was a bad , bad tradeoff ) .
The US troops fired into the hostile crowd , killing 4 .
It seems clear to me that the manhunt for high Baath officials in the Sunni heartland is being done wrong , or at least in ways that are bad for US standing with local Iraqis .
Google has finally had an analyst day -- a chance to present the company 's story to the ( miniscule number of ) people who have n't heard it .
Usually , these are just a chance for the suckups to suck up , but this time people are actually concerned about the company 's plans .
They work on Wall Street , after all , so when they hear a company who's stated goals include " Do n't be evil , " they imagine a company who's eventually history will be " Do n't be profitable . "
It 's not quite as freewheeling an environment as you 'd imagine : Sergey Brin has actually created a mathematical ' proof ' that the company 's self - driven research strategy , which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their own , is a good , respectable idea .
Read the entire article ; there 's a punchline , too .
My opinion piece on the implications of Arafat 's passing for al - Qaeda has appeared at Newsday .
Excerpt :
" Arafat 's secular nationalism was supple enough to compromise with Israel and to imagine a two - state solution , even if the road of negotiations remained rocky .
The continued Israeli colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories during the 1990s helped , along with terrorist attacks by radical groups such as Hamas , to derail the peace process , which Sharon had always opposed .
Arafat 's death creates a vacuum in Palestinian leadership that will not soon be filled .
Sharon 's assassination of major Hamas leaders has also weakened authority structures in that party .
If the Israelis and the Palestinian leadership can not find a way to reinvigorate the peace process , cells of radical young Palestinians may grow up that look to bin Laden for their cues .
Even if local Palestinian leaders remain strong enough to keep al - Qaida out , the festering Israeli - Palestinian struggle remains among the best recruiting posters for al - Qaida with young Muslim men .
Resolving this conflict would be the most effective weapon the United States could deploy in its war on terror . "
Xinhua reports that a wide range of Iraqi political forces on Tuesday condemned Sharon 's murder of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , a religious leader of Hamas , the day before .
The Board of Muslim clerics in Fallujah , 50 km west of Baghdad , " condemned the assassination and promised immediate revenge against the coalition soldiers in Iraq . "
Ash - Sharq al - Awsat reports that Fallujah was closed Tuesday in a general strike .
US troops there clashed with guerrillas in a fight that left one Iraqi dead .
In Ramadi , there was a big demonstration .
Radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr said the attack was " criminal " and that " the Zionists have left only one choice for the Arabs , that of fighting and jihad " .
The interim Governing Council issued a communique saying , " It is a proof of the emptiness of the Israeli authority and a destruction of the peace endeavors in the region . . .
This operation would only consolidate the terrorist acts in the world and would not bring peace to the region , " the message claimed .
Xinhua alleged that " Many of the Iraqis , who suffer the American occupation of Iraq , relate their case with that of the Palestinian people , under the Israeli occupation . "
In an apparently unrelated incidents , some eleven Iraqis were killed by snipers on Tuesday , including a group of police trainees in a bus near Hilla and two police in Kirkuk .
Ever since the first whispers about Google 's IPO , most investors have feared that the stock would come public at such a ridiculously high price that , even with a spectacularly profitable business model and some nearly flawless execution , the price would be too high for investors to make a real profit .
We 've moved on .
We 've grown up .
Now , people wonder if Google can even survive .
That 's overstating it , I know .
What they wonder is whether Google can be anything more than what it 's always been -- a great search engine with some real grass - roots support , successful by the grace of simplicity .
Simplicity gave it that blessed , laudatory lack of clutter , the efficient and effective text - based ads , and the support of anyone with a dial - up connection .
The problem is that customers attracted by a simple interface are among the least loyal you can find -- witness the fight - for - fewest - features between low - end camera companies .
The other problem ?
It 's tough to make money branching out when your appeal is in your focus .
As the survey cited in the above - linked article shows , most Google users do n't intend to use Gmail , and Google is n't even as popular as Yahoo! and AOL .
If they continue to add features so they can justify their likely sky - high valuation , Google risks losing a huge chunk of their customer base to the next keep - it - simple search engine .
Remember when a whole lot of people had to die because a Swedish newspaper printed those cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed ?
Now Iran wants to turn the tables and is inviting cartoonists to do their best by depicting the Holocaust .
Amazingly , these idiots think a cartoon of Mohammed is comparable to what we can expect in this new fun contest :
TEHRAN ( AFP ) -
An international contest of cartoons on the Holocaust opened in Tehran in response to the publication in Western papers last September of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed .
" We staged this fair to explore the limits of freedom Westerners believe in , " Masoud Shojai , head of the country 's " Iran Cartoon " association and the fair organizer , said .
" They can freely write anything they like about our prophet , but if one raises doubts about the Holocaust he is either fined or sent to prison , " he added .
" Though we do not deny that fact that Jews were killed in the ( second world ) war , why should the Palestinians pay for it ? "
Shojai told the opening ceremony of the month - long fair in Tehran 's Palestine Contemporary Art Museum .
He added that around 1,100 cartoons were submitted by participants from more than 60 countries and that more than 200 are on show .
He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2 , with the winners being awarded prizes of 12,000 , 8,000 and 5,000 dollars respectively .
This cute little stunt is only going to prove just how fanatic the extremist Muslims are .
When they saw a cartoon of their prophet , people had to die .
When their precious cartoons are released I highly doubt it will look like the end of the world .
US Marines moved into most of Fallujah on Wednesday , though they were still meeting pockets of resistance .
The Fallujah fighting has killed fair numbers of Iraqi noncombatants , including Shaikh Abdul Wahhab al - Janabi of the respected Association of Muslim Scholars .
Armed clashes broke out in several northern Iraqi cities on Wednesday , leaving some 22 persons dead in Mosul , Baiji , and Tuz .
Hundreds of persons mounted demonstrations against the Fallujah campaign in Tikrit and Huwaijah , as well , according to az - Zaman .
The battles and demonstrations were provoked by the US assault on Fallujah .
Guerrillas threatened to assassinate Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and Minister of Defense Hazem Shaalan in retaliation for the attack .
Allawi 's aged cousin and the man 's wife and daughter - in - law were abducted and guerrillas threaten to behead them if the Fallujah compaign is not stopped .
In Iraqi society , PM Allawi is responsible for protecting his clan , including especially his first cousins , so this kidnapping makes him look weak and brings substantial shame on him .
The US Marines took most of Fallujah Wednesday , but still face pockets of resistance .
If Samarra and other cities are any guide , those pockets of resistance could go on bedeviling the US for some time to come .
The intrepid Ed Wong of the NYT has more on the Sunni boycott of the elections .
He reports that the Iraqi Islamic Party , which had earlier been absolutely committed to getting out the Sunni vote , is now wavering and saying their position will depend on the situation .
The outbreak of demonstrations and violence throughout the Sunni Arab regions on Wednesday did not bode well for Sunni participation in the January elections .
Jim Lobe has more on the political implications of the Fallujah assault , both in Iraq and in Washington .
For some black satire on Fallujah , see Unconfirmed Sources which has some fun with my Weblog .
[ Am at a conference and ca n't blog much right now but will try to catch up the next couple of days . ]
The hottest item on Christmas wish lists this year is nuclear weapons .
Al - Qaeda wants them , Iran wants them , Russia wants the better ones , and all the US wants is to give them all a piece of coal .
For the last few years there have been tensions with Iran ’s nuclear program with word coming this week that a deal was reached through the European Union that meets with the approval of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
At the same time , an Iranian Opposition Group released what they call proof of a covert nuclear weapons program .
Arial photos , loose connections to AQ Kahn and Libya make up the evidence that the group presented .
Russia also announced that it was seeking and building the best nukes the world ’s ever seen .
President Vladimir Putin said Russia is will have new nuclear weapons that other countries do not and will not have .
With the demand so high , the question arises on to who should be or has the right to be the Santa of nuclear weapons .
Right now that seems to be the US , EU , and IAEA .
But not always do those three agree , and not always are their decisions equal .
The US has strongly opposed a nuclear weapons program of Iran , yet Israel , which to this day has never officially said that they posses nuclear weapons , ranks around fifth in nuclear strength .
It is estimated that Israel has over 200 nuclear weapons yet neither the US nor any of her allies expresses the slightest concern .
North Korea ’s Kim Jong Ill also has the bomb at the top of his list and Santa seems to have already come a few years ago .
It is rumored that North Korea has at least a couple nuclear weapons .
But getting past who should get them , is who has them , and who is really close .
The case against Iran has a feeling of Déjà vu .
Arial photos of the lab were uranium is being enriched , somewhat like those of chemical weapons stockpiles in Iraq .
America cried wolf in Iraq , and what ’s scary is that sooner or later , that wolf will probably get us .
I ran across this item on the Internet .
Sooooo .
The United States goes into a war zone and evacuates a bunch of U.S. citizens ( most of whom were " dual - citizens " ) .
Then , eschewing normal procedure , the Department of State waived the fees that they charge for evacuating U.S. citizen .
Why ?
To pander to the mythical " Arab street " , of course .
Now , I would argue that one could have reasonably predicted that some form of military violence was likely to occur in Lebanon ( considering that the country has been experiencing some form of conflict for approximately the last 32 years ) .
In other words , those Americans were there by their own choice , mired in a situation that was totally predictable .
Yet we did n't charge them for the evacuation .
This is unlike the situation last year in Asia when we evacuated U.S. citizens from areas that were hit by the tsunami - a phenomenon that is much less predictable than the Hezbollah - provoked destruction that rained down on Lebanon .
And what do we get for this effort ?
A lawsuit .
That 's right , folks .
The American - Arab Discrimination Committee is suing Condoleeza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld , charging that they mismanaged the evacuation efforts .
Here 's an excerpt from the article :
Nina Chahine , 19 , who with her family was among the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit , said her wedding in the southern city of Tyre was set for July 13 .
The wedding had to be postponed as family members fled the outbreak of the war , she said .
" We were on the road and the first bridge was bombed and we drove home and all the other bridges were bombed and there was absolutely no way for us to get home , " Chahine told reporters outside federal court in Detroit .
" We were all American citizens and there was no way that anybody helped us .
No communications nothing .
I was on my way to my wedding fearing death , basically . "
Chahine said her immediate family spent about $ 20,000 to return to Detroit via Syria and Jordan .
Dear Nina ,
Here 's a tip : Do n't get married in countries that house illegal militias that attack other countries and hence are likely to come under counter-attack !
Crap like this sure makes me want to rush right out and rescue people from dilemmas of their own making .
Though I am loathe to quote other writers at legnth in this space , this little bit from Dan Froomkin 's " White House Briefing " column in the WashPost today is just too good to pass up ( read the whole column here ) :
At the Ask the President event on Friday , one of the questions was about whether Bush has any thoughts about his memoirs .
This is one example of what happens when Bush gets a question that he has n't anticipated .
" Q Thank you -- I was wondering , there 's a lot of talk right now about memoirs being written with the former President .
After you are elected in 2004 , what will your memoirs say about you , what will the title be , and what will the main theme say ?
" THE PRESIDENT : I appreciate that .
( Laughter . )
There is a painting on my wall in the Oval -- first of all , I do n't know .
I 'm just speculating now .
I really have n't thought about writing a book .
My life is too complicated right now trying to do my job .
( Laughter . )
But if -- there 's a painting on the wall in the Oval Office that shows a horseman charging up a steep cliff , and there are at least two other horsemen following .
It 's a Western scene by a guy named W.H.S. Koerner called ' A Charge to Keep . '
It 's on loan , by the way , from a guy named Joe O'Neill in Midland , Texas .
He was the person , he and his wife Jan , introduced -- reintroduced me and Laura in his backyard in July of 1977 .
Four months later , we were married .
So he 's got a -- I 'm a decision - maker and I can make good decisions .
( Applause . )
" And so we sang this hymn -- this is a long story trying to get to your answer .
( Laughter . )
This is not a filibuster .
( Laughter . )
That 's a Senate term -- particularly on good judges .
( Applause . )
The hymn was sung at my first inaugural church service as governor .
Laura and I are Methodists .
One of the Wesley boys wrote the hymn .
The painting is based upon the hymn called , ' A Charge to Keep . '
I have .
The hymn talks about serving something greater than yourself in life .
I -- which I try to do , as best as I possibly can .
( Applause . )
" The book -- I guess one way , one thing to think about it is -- one of the themes would be , I was given a charge to keep .
And I gave it all my heart , all my energy , based upon principles that did not change once I got into the Oval Office .
( Applause . ) "
Now that 's a rambling response .
And I have to wonder : Did he forget that he already has a memoir called " A Charge to Keep " ?
That was the name of his " autobiography " -- ghost - written by adviser Karen Hughes in 1999 .
There has been random speculation about Google developiong a new browser and / or acquiring Firefox .
It is true that Google has been in acquisition mode .
They have acquired Urchin , Zipdash , Applied Semantics , Picasa , Blogger , and satellite imaging company Keyhole , so why not Firefox ?
I have no inside information , but I have been following links today that strongly indicate that Google is damn serious about securing permanent control of the leading edge browser technology in Firefox .
Ben Goodger is the lead engineer for Mozilla Firefox .
He announced this in January :
As of January 10 , 2005 , my source of income changed from The Mozilla Foundation to Google , Inc. of Mountain View , California .
My role with Firefox and the Mozilla project will remain largely unchanged , I will continue doing much the same work as I have described above - with the new goal of successful 1.1 , 1.5 and 2.0 releases .
I remain devoted full - time to the advancement of Firefox , the Mozilla platform and web browsing in general .
He also announced this in January :
Welcome Darin !
I just want to extend a big " Welcome ! " to Darin Darin Fisher who joined me at Google this week .
2005 is going to rock !
Darin Fisher wrote this response on January 25 , 2005 :
Me and the big " G "
Following on the heels of Ben 's annoucement yesterday , I thought I 'd post that I have joined Google as well .
Like Ben , I will still be very much involved with the Mozilla project and community :-)
Posted by darin
Ben made another announcement on March 28 , 2005 :
I want to use this opportunity to welcome Brian Ryner to Google !
Brian has been one of the most crucial elements to the success of Mozilla software over the past few years , ...
Great to have you on board !
Now , none of this has been confirmed by Google at the present time , but it 's an old adage that you follow the money to see who is behind something .
In this case , following the talent leads me to think that Google will be making an announcement this year that formalizes the Google - Mozilla / Firefox relationship .
If you have not already seen the Flash movie Epic , you should take a few minutes and view the future history of media as conceived by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson , with music by Aaron McLeran .
In this movie Google and Amazon ( GOOGLEZON ) create a brave new world of media in 2008 .
This is one thought - provoking film .
Every move Google makes brings this particular future closer .
Just one small commment - it 's not possible , as far as I know , for Google to " Aquire " Firefox .
They already have rights to take it , alter it , and release those changes to the world - this is what the whole open source thing is about .
I 'm inclined to say that google is doing what they can to both shape and support the growth of the most popular non-Microsoft browser out there - by taking on the leading lights in Firefox development , they 're ensuring the continued life of the project , and ensuring ( not that I think they need to ) that their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox development team .
It 's this sort of enlightened self interest that keeps large open source projects alive .
Fascinating viewpoint of the future in Epic .
Thanks for the link .
Malach , What you say makes sense .
Acquiring open source talent gives a company an inexpensive way of influencing and anticipating the direction an open source project will go .
It probably gives more bang for the buck than acquiring a private company and having to handle the inevitable culture clashes and process mis-matches .
The Coalition decision to provoke a fight with Muqtada al - Sadr 's movement only three months before the Coalition Provisional Authority goes out of business has to be seen as a form of gross incompetence in governance .
How did the CPA get to the point where it has turned even Iraqi Shiites , who were initially grateful for the removal of Saddam Hussein , against the United States ?
Where it risks fighting dual Sunni Arab and Shiite insurgencies simultaneously , at a time when US troops are rotating on a massive scale and hoping to downsize their forces in country ?
At a time when the Spanish , Thai and other contingents are already committed to leaving , and the UN is reluctant to get involved ?
One answer is that the Pentagon prevented the State Department from running the CPA .
State is the body with experience in international affairs and administration .
The civilians in the Department of Defense only know how to blow things up .
Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz and Feith staffed the CPA with Neoconservatives , most of whom had no administrative experience , no Arabic , and no respect for Muslim culture ( or knowledge about it ) .
They actively excluded State Department Iraq hands like Tom Warrick .
( Only recently have a few experienced State Department Arabists been allowed in to try to begin mopping up the mess . )
The Neocons in the CPA have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want to impose on the Iraqi people , including Polish - style economic shock therapy , some sort of sweetheart deal for Israel , and maybe even breaking the country up into three parts .
The Washington Monthly 's Who 's Who of Neocons in Iraq helps explain the extreme incompetence and possibly double - dealing of many in the CPA .
Sept. 11 Commission member Philip Zelikow , who is close to the Bush administration , admitted on Sept. 10 , 2002 , that the ulterior motive of the Bush administration for the Iraq War was to " protect Israel , " according to the Asian Times .
I have long been a trenchant critic of the Sadrists .
But they have n't been up to anything extraordinary as far as I can see in recent weeks .
Someone in the CPA sat down and thought up ways to stir them up by closing their newspaper and issuing 28 arrest warrants and taking in people like Yaqubi .
This is either gross incompetence or was done with dark ulterior motives that can scarcely be guessed at .
There is a classical logical fallacy , post hoc ergo propter hoc ( Z happens after X , therefore Z is caused by X ) , and I keep revising this posting this evening because I do n't want to fall into it .
But sometimes , of course , when Z happens after X it is because of X .
So I may as well just come out with it : It is pretty suspicious , given the Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reaches of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada :
' A radical Shiite Muslim cleric has expressed solidarity with the militant Palestinian group Hamas and said that he should be considered the group 's " striking arm " in Iraq .
" I have said and I repeat my expression of solidarity which Hassan Nasrallah called for to stand with Hamas , " Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr said Friday in a reference to Nasrallah , the leader of the militant Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah .
Last month , Nasrallah announced that his party would close ranks with Hamas .
" Let ( Hamas ) consider me their striking arm in Iraq because the fate of Iraq and Palestine is the same , " al - Sadr said during a Friday prayer sermon in Kufa , his home base south of Baghdad .
He did comment on what he meant by the phrase . '
And on April 3 his chief aide in Najaf was suddenly arrested along with 13 other members of his organization , and the Coalition forces are put into violent conflict with his organization , which leaves 7 US soldiers dead .
The Army is unlikely to forgive or forget ; but who provoked it and why ?
I 'm not even in Iraq and I could have predicted to you the consequences of doing what the CPA has been doing .
Anthony Shadid of the Washington Post reveals that the warrants for the arrests had been issued months be for .
Why were they suddenly acted on Saturday ?
i am not going unless lisa promises to get all wasted and boob out .

All :
It is my understanding , from good sources in the Gov s office that the Gov will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend all parties auhtority to enter into direct access contracts .
The premise with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously suspend everyone 's right to bilateral contracts quickly , it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must break through .
In other words the table is set .
Deal your meal from where the dishes are located .
I.E. the Davis Administration wants to place all direct access advocates in the position of having to justify why each and every party should be the exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule concerning how direct access should work for all parties .
It clearly gives the Admin a very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can occur without having to say that they oppose direct access .
Power be where power lies .
you are n't going in for the wedding until sunday now ?

I spoke to Bruce Garcey at NiMo regarding their RFP .
Bruce indicated NiMo short listed five companies who all bid higher than ENA .
However , he also mentioned we were a close sixth , that is close to the fifth highest bid .
He gave no indication on the value of the highest bid .
He also said that the other five companies making the short list all proposed alternative structures to the proposed NiMo Tier Structure .
NiMo released an additional RFP for peaking supplies for this winter , I believe Phil should have or be getting that RFP .
Phil if you could please make copies and distribute ASAP .
Thanks ,
Sean
Here you go .

On or about September 23 , 1999 a request for service was placed by the above referenced counterparty .
The request was for a Intrastate Gas Transportation Agreement and 311 Gas Transportation Agreement .
These agreements were forwarded to the counterparty , CCNG , Inc. .
On or about October 6 , 1999 , Kelly Cloud , Senior Vice President of CCNG , Inc. ( 713 ) 235-1972 , called and informed me that the counterparty should be CCGM , L.P. .
Further , she informed me that Section 7 of the agreement , which reads in part : Gas is free from liens and adverse claims of every kind , should be changed because the gas that the counterparty will be transporting on HPL may and / or is subject to liens .
She was instructed to destroy the agreement and another would be forwarded to her with the necessary corrections and re-wording of Section 7 .
Attached find the agreements for the necessary changes in Section 7 .
Kelly
Cloud has instructed me to call with any further questions .
Thanks .
Marlene D. Hilliard

Moving back to Calgary in about a month which is a little sooner than I thought I would be going back but when opportunity knocks you got ta go .
Take care .
I do n't hear from you in months and then you level me with such a thought provoking , soul searching article .
Thanks for thinking of me to send it to .
I really enjoyed reading it .
We certainly fit into certain parts of the article .
There are a few life theories like that which working through .
It s all interesting stuff .
How are things going with you ?

Brokering over here has been pretty rewarding .

I was thinking of converting it to a hover vehicle .
I might just sell the car and get you to drive me around all winter .
How about skidoo skis for the front and tracks for the back ..

You have always been on the move seeking affectionate , satisfying and harmonious relationships .
Your ultimate goal has been the realisation of an intimate union in which there could be love , self - sacrifice and mutual trust .
It has often been said that " True love is just around the corner " ... and maybe ... if you have n't found it as yet - you possibly soon will .
In the past there have been .. and maybe there still are many things that you have had to do without .
You have now decided to set your sights on a position or situation that could give you greater prestige and which will afford you considerable self esteem .
You wear your heart on your sleeve ... and since you are an emotional person you are apt to give your all ... heart and soul ... to all those that show you a little affection ... but take care ... it would appear that you have been extremely hurt in the past ... and you keep leaving yourself wide open for punishment ..
Whatever you strive to do , something always seems to be holding you back .
There is no subterfuge in you .
You are a clear thinker and all you demand from life , in a relationship , is a partner whom you can trust and with whom you can , together , develop a foundation of trust based on understanding .
You are your own person ... and you demand freedom of thought ... to follow your own convictions .
You have no interest in " two - timing " and all you seek is sincerity and " straight - dealing " .
You wish to be left in peace ... no more conflict and no more differences of opinion ...
In fact you just do n't want to be involved in any arguments of any shape or form ...
All you want is for " them " to get on with it - and to leave you alone ..
John ,
sorry for not sending it to you earlier ( totally forgot to open my outlook ) .

Greatly appreciate your prompt feedback to this inquiry .

Dear All ,
My mane is Visit Phunnarungsi .
I used to e-mail Vince Kaminski about the advice on his article " The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity Derivatives " and he had mailed me the copy .
I am now modelling the Queensland electricity spot price using Geometric Brownian Mean Reverting Jump Diffusion Model and have followed your paper " Making the most of mean reversion " to estimate the mean reversion speed .
I use Queensland half - hourly price during 13 December , 1998 - 30 June 2001 giving about 44,000 price observations .
However , the result from Ordinary Least Squares was not as expected due to different sign for both slope & intercept .
The coefficient and standard error are as followed :
Intercept : - 0.3931 ( 0.0076 )
Slope : 0.1171 ( 0.0022 )
R Square : 0.0585
Therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate as the estimated slope has the positive sign .
I have also tried monthly data and the results are the same .
It would be appreciated if you could advice me on this matter .
Kindest regards ,

Vince -
Thanks for the message regarding a possible intern for your group .
Right now , we are in the process of evaluating both our new hire needs and our summer needs and will be making those decisions after the first of the year .
Until we have come up with those numbers it would be premature to make any offers for the summer .
What I would like to do in this case is get the information to Jeff Davis , who is responsible for Georgia Tech and ask him to get Sungjoo 's resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like to hire him for summer .
When we start the summer process , we will interview the candidate and slot him for your group .
Is this okay with you ?
Hope all is well with you
Take Care

I have visited Georgia Tech on Thursday .
One of the students indicated that he is interested in a summer internship .

Dear Dr. Vincent Kaminski ,
Hi .
How are you doing ?
I hope you have a good flight back to home .
It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector .
Thank you for your time .
I have already submitted my resume and cover letter right after the talk .
However , you ask me to send a copy of resume and cover letter again .
Those attachments are what I was asked .
Again , it was a good chance for me to get to know what I can do in this field and what I have to more focus on in school .
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day .
Thank you .

Phillip ,
This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event .
The way the tax law works , the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent .
As such , we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent .
We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement ( 6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares ) .
If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check , we can distribute gross shares .
Please let me know you preference .
As you know , we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt .
As such , we have a CPA , Larry Lewis , working with us to audit and set up transition files .
He has become our department expert on the PSA account ( much more knowledgeable than myself ) and the various plan provision amendments .
If you would like , we can set up a conference call with you , myself , and Larry to go over the payment methodology .
Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you .
Thanks ,
Renee
Renee ,
Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units .
It is clear that the payment will be made in shares .
However , I still do n't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares .
The plan document under VII .
Amount of Benefit Payments reads " The value of the shares , and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment , and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock . "
Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account .
Thank you ,
Phillip Allen

Like you said " the kids egg him on " .
maybe too much .
Sounds like your cat is stressed out .
Maybe he does n't want to play when they want to ..
He did n't take a dislike to the kids for " no " reason !
cats react to the treatment they receive , they are not toys .
maybe the cat needs a " new ' home .........

Hello dear list members ,
The multiple planetary afflictions are taking their toll .
Currently , Mercury and Venus is conjunct and the conjunction is being closely aspected by Rahu .
In Pakistan national chart besides the transit affliction to transit Venus in the fourth house by FMs Rahu and Mercury , natal Saturn and Venus are also under the close affliction of transit Rahu .
This has resulted in a major rail accident in Pakistan involving three trains and involving more than 300 deaths .
In Indian national chart besides the transit affliction to transit Mercury by Rahu and Venus the natal Saturn and Venus are also under the transit affliction of Rahu which has resulted into floods in many parts of the country taking toll of human lives , properties , etc .

Several years ago I developed a short paper and pencil screening test which , in a small pilot study , discriminated between ADHD , LD , and control subjects .
I recently converted this test to an online test in order to norm it to a larger population and , subsequently , to make it available to any one who has access to a computer and the Internet .
The test itself is what is called a substitution test .
It has two parts , both of which are timed for 90 seconds each and the differential between the resulting two scores determines the likelihood of having a learning disability or attention deficit disorder .
I am in need of test subjects and hope you will take it .
The test , along with an information form , is available at : .
I think a test like this one is much needed .
A person can take it directly instead of others completing behavioral checklists or a completing a lengthy program intensive test like TOVA .
Perhaps you are willing to recommend this site and , if you have a website , place a link on your website .
are there any sadists out there who share the same tastes as i do ?
i do nt know what it is , but since a very young age i have had a strange but very gratifying urge to torture or maime animals .
i am deadly serious , i really do get sexual releif from even hearing of torture of animals , now some people may call me a brute or a coward but i ca nt help my true feelings .
badger baiting is natrually a huge turn on , so i thought a few words in this group might uncover some mutual enthusiasts .
sincere appologies to anyone who is offended by my request but my request is genuine .

Once upon a time ( in 2001 , to be specific ) , the Coca - Cola corporation built a bottling plant in a small and remote Indian village in the state of Kerala .
In exchange for sucking vast amounts of water out of the local land , the mighty corporation promised to bring the people great wealth .
But within a few short months , the village people began to notice their wells were running dry , so they complained to the corporation .
Coca - Cola calmed the concerns of the people and attempted to win back their favor by giving them vast amounts of free fertilizer , saying it would grow bountiful crops beyond their wildest dreams .
After several years of use , we arrive at the present day when the village people have suddenly discovered the fertilizer is actually the bottling plant 's waste sludge and is laden with cadmium , a highly toxic , cancer - causing heavy metal .
The village soil and water are now too heavily contaminated to safely occupy human life , so the plant was shut down last week .
Moral of the story : Do n't drink Coke .......... drink Pepsi !
Just kidding , Pepsi is actually in the process of being thrown out of India for similar crimes , as well .
The Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center ( GNOFHAC ) filed a housing discrimination complaint against the Housing Authority of New Orleans ( HANO ) last week .
The complaint , filed with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development , accuses HANO of violating a 2003 enforcement agreement entered into between former St. Thomas Housing Development residents , the City of New Orleans , HANO , and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development during the HOPE VI redevelopment of St. Thomas , now known as River Garden .
The current complaints allege that HANO has not provided qualified former St. Thomas residents a preference with respect to available public housing units at River Garden per the 2003 agreement .
Upon return to New Orleans after the Hurricane Katrina evacuation , former residents have been informed that there are no available public housing units at River Garden because those units have been reserved for HANO employees .
Therefore , public housing residents have been unable to secure the units for which they qualified prior to the storm and are left homeless , as a result .
" In the wake of Hurricane Katrina , affordable housing in New Orleans is more scarce than ever .
As such , it is essential that HANO comply with 2003 enforcement agreement , " said James Perry , GNOFHAC Executive Director
Crude - oil prices rose Wednesday as strengthening Hurricane Rita , now a Category 5 storm , threatened to disrupt oil production in the Gulf of Mexico .
New York 's main contract , light sweet crude for delivery in November rose 60 cents to close at 66.80 dollars per barrel .
In London , the price of Brent North Sea crude for November delivery advanced 53 cents to 64.73 dollars .
After brushing the Florida Keys islands on Tuesday , Rita packed winds of about 240 kilometers an hour as it headed across the Gulf of Mexico .
The US National Hurricane Center said Rita was " extremely dangerous " and could become a top - level category five storm on the Saffir - Simpson scale .
The storm threatened oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico where about one - quarter of US oil operations are based .
Oil companies evacuated offshore facilities as the storm 's progress kept global markets on tenterhooks .
In Texas , BP shut its 460,000 barrels per day refinery and Marathon shut its 72,000 bpd plant .
Valero said it was reducing rates at its 243,000 bpd Texas City refinery and its 85,000 bpd Houston refinery .
Exxon Mobil released nonessential staff from two giant Texas plants .
Last month , Katrina devastated refineries in Louisiana and Mississippi and sent prices to a record high of 70.85 dollars a barrel .

NASA is looking to private companies to launch both supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station , it announced this week .
[ ... ]
" It 's not cost - effective doing station flights while at the same time focusing on getting back to the Moon , " says Brett Alexander , vice-president of Transformational Space , one of the companies hoping to launch astronauts to the ISS .
NASA intends upon retiring the space shuttles in 2010 , which only leaves it with 18 flights towards the ISS .
Outsourcing these responsibilities would be a wise alternative , considering the accomplishments of the private sector regarding the space elevator .
Although some may praise this as an opportunity for the private sector to finally serve the public good , NASA seems hesitant about turning over the reigns to the corporate world .
( New Scientist Space )
On 3 November , NASA administrator Michael Griffin told the US house science committee that the agency expects to invest about $ 500 million in the commercial cargo and crew project over five years .
" That kind of a financial incentive [ ... ] will be sufficient to allow substantial providers to emerge , " Griffin said .
" I hope that industry , if put to the test , can do better [ than the government ] , but I do not expect it , " Griffin added .
Only time will reveal whether Griffin 's expectations are either exceeded or confirmed .
But seeing how the private sector has been able to successfully transport civilians to the ISS ( at about a fifth of the cost ) , it would come to no surprise if corporate America was able to out perform their bureaucratic friends in government .

[ http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/apmideast_story.asp?category=1107&slug=Palestinians%20Abbas ]
Normally this author is semi-objective ( what blogger is ) but on the Seattlepi.com ( see source link ) Palestinian Leader Mahmoud Abbas has demanded that Israel leave all the land that it occupies before the 1967 border ( which includes East Jerusalem by the way ) .
One thing is certain for sure .
If Abbas keeps up this " macho talk " he will kill potential peace talks and might as well allow Hamas ( which has probably done a better job at providing for the Palestinians ) rule the West Bank .
AP Photo / Nasser Nasser
Interim Palestinian leader and the front - runner in the upcoming Jan. 9 , 2005 presidential election Mahmoud Abbas talks during his first official campaign speech in the West Bank town of Ramallah , Saturday Dec. 25 , 2004 .
Cloaking himself in Yasser Arafat 's legacy , Abbas pledged to fulfill Palestinian dreams of statehood .
It seems that the Palestinian leadership ( upcoming ) will not be a peace partner with Israel .
He is already demanding claims that Israel said no to not only the world , but to Arafat himself .
Listing his priorities , Abbas told supporters of the ruling Fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and continue the struggle against Israel 's partially completed West Bank barrier .
Abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants .
Abbas , a refugee himself from what is today the northern Israeli city of Safed , called the refugee issue " very important and very dangerous . "
Having personally visited the West Bank and Israel , I can say that this new political voice is threatening to collapse the peace process .
If Abbas does not change his former thinking and continues the path of Yasser Arafat , then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinians will ultimately suffer .
Selah !

( Hat Tip : Captain s Quarters )
( BBC )
The Palestinian militant organisation Hamas has announced an end to rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip after a weekend of escalating violence .
Up to 40 rockets had been fired at Israel , weeks after its military withdrew from the territory .
In response to the rockets , Israel resumed its policy of targeting militant leaders in air strikes .
Authorised by Ariel Sharon to make " unrestricted " strikes , its military launched new missile attacks overnight .
It looks as if Hamas has thrown in the towel for this round , unable to take the beating the Israeli Defense Forces have unleashed upon this terrorist group .
Mahmoud Zahar , Hamas 's leader declared the cease fire after Israel killed it's former leader , Muhammed Sheikh Khalil .
Hamas has become rather unpopular in Gaza , as many see the Israeli air strikes as a response towards the rocket attacks upon Israeli soil .
Egypt had a role to play as they convinced Hamas to end the attacks , although the same can not be said of Islamic Jihad .
( Jerusalem Post )
" We 're not happy with Hamas 's position at this stage and in light of the Israeli escalation against the Palestinians , " commented Khader Habib , a senior Islamic Jihad official .
" But it seems that Hamas has its own political agenda . "
[ ... ]
" The problem is not with the Palestinian resistance groups but with Israel 's scheme to destroy the Palestinians ' infrastructure , " Habib said .
" Hamas remains targeted by Israel , as in the past , and the Israeli occupation does not need excuses to pursue its aggression .
Israel wants to drive the Palestinians toward civil war . "
Islamic Jihad has refused to recognized the cease fire , and hopes to turn the Gaza strip " into a vast battlefield . "
Unless President Mahmoud Abbas steps in , Gaza will probably look like a battle field by the time Israel is done reminding Hamas of their critical error , although currently the only thing Abbas is doing is lashing out and refusing to take responsibility for his inability to act .

They might be imprisoned or executed
Yes , it would be an execution punishment .

I have a male and female cockatiel , and there are 2 eggs in the bottom of the cage , will they hatch ?
Most likely not , if there is not a bird sitting on the eggs .
This is hard to tell .
Cockatiels can lay unfertilized eggs as well .
Just because you have a male and female , it can not be guaranteed the two mated .
You can try picking up the eggs and holding it up against a very bright light .
If you see a dark spot in the egg , that means it is fertilized and will hatch if cared for properly .
Have fun .
Why is the city called Miramar ?
I 'm not sure about the origin of the name but they are a lot of different cities with different and unique names like Miramar so it 's just a name .
There 's lots of towns called Miramar , it 'd help a lot if you listed a state or some sort of context you 're looking for it in .
Here 's two examples :
There 's a Miramar in Florida , just north of Miami .
There 's also a Miramar in California , the site of a rather large Air Force Base ...
Miramar California is a bit north of San Diego .

But I did find this website , www.igourmet.com , where they sell all types of sausages , including blood sausages !
So follow the link at the bottom and buy some blood sausages .
huh ?
yuck !!
I do n't know , and it is because I do n't like them , do you know that , morcillas is coagulated blood from animals , ewww

What is your cat s name and why did you name him / her that ?
If you HAVE a cat of course .
My cat s name is Twinky .
When she was a tiny little kitten she looked like those twinky snack cakes .
She is a creme tabby and I 've had her for over 2 years now .
I have a siamese lynx name Star we called her that because she has a star pattern on her face .
And she is the STAR of the family .
I love her . :)
I have a Norwegian Forest Cat that is named Achilles bc as a kitten he always attacked your feet when you walked by !
My cat s Called Frank because the year we got him was the year Frank Sinatra died
He also had bright blue eyes like Frank Sinatra did :)
what does it mean when a veiled chameleon egg is soft ?
my female chameleon just laid eggs yesterday and today some of the eggs are soft when i mean soft i mean like not like ordinary chameleon eggs .
They are probably infertile .
If there is no male they are probably infertile !
If you take a flash light and shine it through the eggs and you see nothing throw them away !
If you do not they will start to rot !
If she has no male to fertilize the eggs , the eggs will aways be infertile .
if you do have a male but they are not in the same cage or breeding but you touch him then her she will smell his sent and probably lay eggs .
Hope she stops laying eggs because she will get really skinny !
If she continues !
Hope this helps
I have 24 hrs in San Francisco - what are the best sights to see in my short time ?

We are staying next to the airport which is located next to BARTrail .
We have limited time What are the best sights to see , geiven that we only have a short time ?

alcatraz island
Take a ferry ride !!!
It 's an amazing experience !
Is it better to book a cruise online or by a travel agent ?
First time to go on A cruise any and all info is appreciated
Personally , I do n't find a travel agent to be of value to me as I am willing to put in the time doing research on the internet .
I have not had good experience with travel agents .
They do n't seem to know anything but the hype they are told and the packages they have available to them .
The one time I actually booked through a travel agent I did not get all of the amenities I had paid for .
The few times I have consulted with a travel agent I was able to find the same for less on my own , and more options than what they were selling .
So now I do not bother with them at all .
best is using an online travel agent
My Hamster escaped .... NEED HELP NOW !?
okay .... I have a dog and my mother is really really terrified of hamsters .
Well last night while I was sleeping , my hamster escaped from his cage .
He is in my room , but there are so many things inside there , I du n no what to do .
I have lots of containers in there .
Anybody give me ideas like a trap or something ?
Find him before he finds the dog food .
I 'm not kidding , I once lost a hamster in my house 3 months later I walk down in the basement and it was as big as a rat .
It had been eating dog food the whole time .
It was huge and scared the crap out of me .
Make sure he is n't trapped somewhere & put a bowl of food out .
He will come and eat
Start cleaning and start looking .
can i have some indoor pet ideas please !!!!!!!!!!!!!?
i want a small indoor pet that my mother will let me have please help
i want something cheap east to take care of and something to hopefully fit in my room
no pet is really easy to take care of .
they all need love and attn , food , proper surroundings etc .
the easiest thing would be a fish - but u need to clean the tank weekly , feed it the right amt , etc etc x
Having a pet is n't easy .
You should treat all pets like children .
They require a lot of attention or they get fussy and tear stuff up .
If you want easy then go with a gold fish or hamster .
I would go with a small rodent such as a mouse , rat , hamster or gerbil if you want something you can handle and hold .
Fish are probably the easiest to take care of though .
french male sensuality ?
I ve been dating a man from brittany france for a couple of months now .
He 's been away for a week and I was thinking of waiting for him in his apartment wearing only his dress shirt .
It s still a fairly new relationship and we have nt had sex yet so it s kind of a big deal .
I just do nt want to freak him out or make him feel uncomfortable .
Is it ok for a woman in french culture to make the first move ?
What do french men find sexy ?
French women are the ones to say yes , the way we say it is not usually as straigthforward as you propose to do .
Why not wait for him in a sexy dress with lunch or dinner , or a light snack at his house .
And you take it up from there .
Just make sure that it is a light meal with little alcohol .

Lied right to my face then denied it .
Run away .
Great service

Great teacher .
SERVERS
When my server crashed , Greg worked from 7 PM until 4 AM and had my company up and running the next morning .
That 's what I call customer service !
It 's fine for ...
It 's fine for mass - market chocolate , but with companies like Scharffen Berger , TCHO , and smaller artisan chocolate makers in the area , why ?
Rip Off !
45 p for tap water !
Ridiculous !
Do n't think I 've ever been charged before .
Oh , and salad cream , not mayonnaise , on the coleslaw .
Avoid !

wrong location
this is not where the Blue Water Bridge Duty Free is located .
It is , surprisingly , near the Blue Water Bridges , some miles to the west of this location .
such a great idea this was , so easy to load and pack , no ramp , no step up no back aches .
moving with a pod was the best moving experience i have had .
Totally flavored
The statement about " best hamburguers in town " can be even amplifiaed to " best hamburguers in world " Totally worth , juicy , big , fresh , and excellent customer service !

Such a relaxing atmosphere and inspiring architecture .
Sand Hill park was a great beach ...
Nice warm water .
Thank - You for sharing your cottage !
Great lunch specials .
Delivery is lightning fast .
Perfect since I 'm on a budget .
But otherwise , it can feel pricey for what you get .
Like the sushi , do n't like the pad thai .
Holly - the owner , knows exactly how to make you feel beautiful in clothes .
Stylish and contemporary , no matter your size or personality type .
She 's an A + and so are her clothes !
Very poor customer service .
There are a couple decent people working there , but the rest are VERY dishonest , as well as rude , I have yet to hear the truth come out of their mouths .
Give them a try !
The pizzas are huge and super delicious .
They 're our favorite pizza place to order from ... and they 're a local , family owned company !
How much better does it get ?!
I loved the atmosphere here and the food is good , however the tables are so close together that it feels very cramped .
We were made to feel very welcome .
Well worth a visit .

I will never come here again .
I am a new patient .
I have visited Dr. Cooper 's office twice and I am very impressed with how friendly and polite the staff is .
I found the office to be very clean and professional - looking .
Want a great burger ?
The smokehouse ca n't be beat anywhere .
Salad bar is hit and miss for freshness - sometimes the broccoli looks browned around the edges .
Never a bad smokehouse burger though !
I crave those .
Natasha is the BEST photographer we have ever worked with .
She has a great way with children and is able to capture their personality as well as many spontaneous images .

ONe of a few .
Hancocks is one of four fabric stores in Fort Smith .
We have Hobby Lobby , Just for Fun Fabrics , Walmart , and Interior Mall just inside Barling .
They do have a good selection of fabric and notions .
It was ok , nice management , they let us check in early , but the place was old .
It was clean , but just a little dumpy .
Lots of room for big rig parking .
Hard to get into though because of road construction .
I 'll admit I was n't expecting much from this place , but they really did do a good job .
The chicken cordon - blu was tasty and came in a huge portion size for the money .
Service was a touch slow , but friendly .

Run down .
Dark , dark main room .
No way to read / relax .

Excellent location .
Good sports bar .
Hyatt web site improved .
Accurate check - out .
Rooms clean .
Lifts quick , clean , accurate , and correctly sized .
Choose this hotel over the Hilton ( which is on the next block ) .
Summary : Not cheep , but very fast , and super friendly service .
Quality of work is sufficient but not outstanding .
Like all oil place changes , ask / recommend the 100 other services they have .
Will be a repeat customer with discount coupons .
criminal defense lawyer
Mr. Villega is an exceptional California criminal defense lawyer .
He cross examined witnesses relentlessly and had them break down and tell the truth .
If you want an attorney who will defend your right , contact Law Offices of Armando Villega
Checked in real late , but staff was very kind and helpful .
Rooms very clean and smelled very fresh .
I would recommend this hotel to anyone .
I loved my stay here and if ever back in the area , I will be staying here again .
Thanks for following me around the store
Enough said .
I do n't steal , I was n't acting suspiciously .
I was ready to buy a new jacket , a new sweater and a couple of your overpriced belts and I walked out because of your obvious lurking

GREAT Store GREAT Service !
“ This store is great !!
I love walking in and not being hassled .
I was there when they did a free raffle in August and I won a hard drive !
The reason I go back is because the employees are sooooo nice . ”
Horrible customer service .
I came in to get a nice gift for my wife .
The one guy who was there , I 'm guessing was the owner , was probably the least helpful person I 've ever met .
But thankfully there are other flowers shops around Norman .
Pure Beauty
What a joy to stroll off historic Canyon Road in Santa Fe into a gallery with a gorgeous diversity of art .
Destiny Allison 's metal sculptures were my favorite .
The owner Karla is welcoming and fun .
Give yourself the gift of visiting Winterowd Fine Art !
Great Place !
This is one of my favorite places to eat for lunch .
They offer a good portions at a great price , it 's enough food to fill you up , but you do n't ever feel like you ate too much .
Plus , it 's super healthy !

Chuck and Gretchen were very positive , and when Alan 's refused to work on my bike , Chuck came right out and saw the problem and did what Alan 's mechanic would n't do .
He worked on it right on the back of my car .
I am extremely pleased
Quick and Cheap
Walked in and was out ta there in 10 mins with a really good deal i thought i was going to be paying a lot because i had a DUI but with my DUI and Sr - 22 they were able to get me the best deal out there .
Is not a service office
This is a delivery office only and does not take walk ins but they do have a blue box out front .
Glad I called before I arrived with my box to ship .
Thought adding a comment would save someone the hassle with a useless trip there .
the food is mediocre at best .
the waitress took my name and then called me that all night .
not sure how I feel about that one .
it 's passable as a pub , but the pizza is not that great .
if you want good pizza , go to famoso .
seriously .
Anyone else find it a little suspicious that there are not only 20 reviews for this dentist ( a HUGE number compared to the others in the area ) , but that they all have the same unique grammar structure ?
And they seem to be posted at fairly regular intervals ?
Best YET !
We go to Japaneiro 's all the time and we have NEVER been disappointed !
Wait staff is always ready to help if you ca n't decide ( which happens every time for me d / t the huge menu of rolls ) and always courteous !
Soooo tasty !
Good honest wrok
Harlan provides great service .
He is very knowledgeable and took the time to explain the repairs to me .
The work on my car was done quickly and I felt I could trust his work .
I have nothing but fantastic things to say .
I highly recommend his shop .
Best in Memphis
This shop is by far the best I have been to .
I have a Saab ... which everything is expensive on and they have been extrememly fair and price a lot lower than any other shop I called .
They are the only place I would take my car peiod .
Took a laptop in for a video cable to be replaced .
Everything except the display worked fine before I took it in .
The video cable was replaced and suddenly the motherboard was dead .
Phone calls were n't returned when promised and the botched repair took a week longer than promised .
We have stayed at Tanglewood for many years now .
We go over about 5 times a year .
We have never had a problem with the cabins .
They are always so helpful .
The cabins have always been clean .
Helen is a wonderful place to take you family .
We recommend these cabins !
Ca n't say enough
I used to tan down the street before I was referred to this place by one of my friends .
WOW !
I did n't know what I was missing .
The lowest bed here is better than my last salon s highest level .
Salon is clean and girls are nice .
Great People and even better service !
Best to deal with !
In a few words ... I 'm pleasantly surprised that you can still find " old school " service out there where company care more about good name and customers than their pockets ...
Highly recommended people / business .
Thanks Josh !
Dentist you can trust
If possible I try the services on myself before I bring in my son .
Drs. Ali work wonders .
Neither me nor my son have n't had a single cavity since we started dental care there .
The team focus is prevention and education .
That alone makes them unique .
This is not your usual cheap hotdog place .
They offer a large variety of quality hotdogs and hamburgers They also offer veggie dogs .
The fries are of good quality , the staff is friendly .
The atmosphere is your typical indie outfit with old movie posters and memorabilia from the 70's and 80's .
Over charged .
I used my card to purchase a meal on the menu and the total on my receipt was $ 8.95 but when I went on line to check my transaction it show $ 10.74 .
There is something wrong or maybe the individual made a mistake but to me that is not integrity .
Elmira , you r the best !
All I can say is that Elmira you are the best I ve experienced , never before has the seamstress done a perfect job until i met you .
I recommend you to everyone in Calgary , as she is a professional and the cost for her was low .
5 star detail job
I took my Mustang here and it looked amazing after they were done , they did a great job , I 'm very satisfied with the results .
The paint and wheels looked like glass and the interior looked new !
Also , they have great customer service and a very knowledgeable staff
When a user connects to the SQL Server database through a Microsoft Access project , the connection is enabled through a Windows NT user account .
SQL Server verifies that the account name and password were validated when the user logged on to the system and grants access to the database , without requiring a separate logon name or password .
With the default installation of the Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine with integrated security , the user must be a member of the administrator group for the machine on which the Access project resides .
This makes it difficult to allow other users to gain access to the Access project .
There is currently no simple way for the system administrator to create new logon accounts to the locally installed SQL Server database except by using SQL Tools or Transact-SQL ( TSQL ) commands .
See the http://officeupdate.microsoft.com/ , Microsoft Developer Network Web site for more information on TSQL .
You can change the security mode for accessing the SQL Server database on a computer running Windows NT .
By setting properties from the View menu , you can enable mixed mode security .
Using the default SA account , users can access the SQL Server database through the Access project without any additional security requirements .
The administrator of the SQL Server can also add additional security by changing the default SA account password .
In order for the Enable system administrator ( SA ) user name check box to be enabled , the following must be true .
The Access project must be connected to a SQL Server 7.0 ( or later ) database or a Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine .
The SQL Server database must be running on a Windows NT platform .
The SQL Server must be running on the same computer as the Access project .
The current Windows NT user must be an Administrator for the computer .
The current SQL Server user must be a member of the System Administrator role .
After changing the security mode , it is strongly recommended that the SA password be changed by using the Set Login Password command ( on the Tools menu , point to Security ) .

About XML data and Access
Extensible Markup Language ( XML ) is the standard language for describing and delivering data on the Web , just as Hypertext Markup Language ( HTML ) is the standard language for creating and displaying Web pages .
Microsoft Access provides ways to both import and export XML data as well as transform the data to and from other formats using XML related files .
About XML
Moving information across the Internet and between software applications has always been difficult due to differences in data formats and proprietary structures .
HTML , while well suited for providing text and image display information for Web browsers , is limited in its ability to define data and data structures .
HTML describes how a Web page should look , whereas XML defines the data and describes how the data should be structured .
XML is a data interchange format in that it allows you to exchange data between dissimilar systems or applications .
XML separates the data from the presentation so that the same XML data can be presented in multiple ways by using different presentation files .
XML is a standards-based protocol that is governed by the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) .
The XML protocol is a set of rules , guidelines , and conventions for designing data formats and structures , in a way that produces files that are easy to generate and easily read by different computers and applications .
In addition , XML defined structures are unambiguous ; that is , they are self-describing and platform-independent .
Like HTML , XML makes use of tags and attributes , but while HTML specifies what each tag and attribute means ( and thus how the data between them will look in a browser ) , XML uses the tags only to delimit pieces of data , and leaves the interpretation of the data completely to the application that reads it .
Additional information about XML can be found on the web site .
About importing XML data
Access provides choices for using data from many external sources .
XML makes it easier to transform the data from almost any external application for use by Access .
You can :
Use an Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation ( XSLT ) file to transform the data into an Access data format .
You can use the Import command ( point to Get External Data on the File menu ) to import XML data files into Access .
This command displays the Import dialog box so that you can select an XML document as well as a schema , which describes the structure of the data .
You can only import a single document at a time into Access .
The data must be in a format that Access recognizes , either in a native format or through the use of a schema .
Note that when importing XML data , you can not choose a subset of the XML document ; the entire file has to be imported .
You can transform the native XML data into a specific Access format by choosing from the options in the Import XML dialog box .
You can also specify whether to overwrite any existing tables or append to existing data .
What are XML schemas
You use XML schemas to describe the structure of data in a common format that customers , other Web browsers , and any number of XML-enabled software programs can recognize .
Specifically , schemas define the rules of an XML data document , including element names and data types , which elements can appear in combination , and which attributes are available for each element .
Schemas provide a model for an XML data document which defines the arrangement of tags and text within all documents referencing the schema .
Access supports the XML Schema standard ( XSD ) .
XSD is a proposed World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) standard designed as a basic infrastructure for describing the type and structure of XML documents .
By using a schema , you can ensure that any XML document that is used to import data into Access or export from Access to another format contains specific data and conforms to a defined structure .
You can also provide the schema to other businesses and applications so that they know how they should structure any data they provide to you and they , in turn , can provide their schema to you .
Displaying XML data
XML syntax ( the tags and their placement in a document ) defines and describes the data in an XML document but does n't indicate how the data should be displayed .
In earlier applications and in some current uses , Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) were used to tell the browser how to display the XML data .
However , a CSS is n't always a good choice because they are written in a specialized language which means that the developer has to use another language in order to write , modify , or understand the structure of the style sheet .
A CSS merely allows you to specify the formatting of each XML element without much control over the output .
On the other hand , an Extensible Stylesheet Language ( XSL ) style sheet is considerably more flexible than a CSS file .
It allows you to precisely select the data that will be displayed , to specify the order or arrangement of the data , and to modify or add information .
You can apply a filter to a row or column field to show the top or bottom n items based on a total .
For example , you can filter for the top or bottom 25 % of salespeople based on the number of orders handled .
Combining multiple filters
Filters are additive .
Each filter you apply is added to the ones you already have in effect .
However , when you apply a filter by selection , the conditional filter already applied on the field is removed before the filter by selection is applied .
Conditional filters are independent of each other .
The result of one conditional filter does not affect the result of another .
An autofilter is always applied before a conditional filter , regardless of the order in which you applied them .
For example , if you set a conditional filter to show the top two cities based on sales , followed by an autofilter on the ShippedCity field to include only five cities , the PivotTable view will show the top two of the five cities you selected .
Removing and reapplying a filter
However , the filter settings are retained , so that when you turn autofiltering back on , the data that was previously displayed or hidden is again displayed or hidden .
Filter settings are retained when you move fields to change the layout .
Also , if you remove a field and later add the field back to the layout , the same items are again hidden .
If you do n't want to retain your filter selections , make sure the AutoFilter button is not selected before you start selecting items to filter .
If the button is not selected , selecting new items to filter automatically turns filtering on and removes your former filter settings .
Identifying filters that are currently in effect
When items in a field are hidden by autofiltering or filter by selection , the drop-down arrow Field arrow in the field label is blue .
Click the blue arrow to see the filter that is in effect .
When items in a field are hidden by conditional filtering , a funnel appears to the left of the drop-down arrow Field arrow .
You can get more information about the current filter in the Properties dialog box .
Effects of filtering on calculations
Totals can include only the displayed data , or both visible and hidden data .
About customizing a control
In Design view of a form , report , or data access page , you can format a control in the following ways :
Size .
You can resize a control by using the sizing handles , or you can resize a control to the height or width of another control .
When you are in Design view of a form or report , you can use the ruler to help you resize controls .
The width of the ruler 's unit of measure is based on the regional settings in Microsoft Windows Control Panel .
Color , transparency , and special effects .
You can change the color of a control or make it transparent .
You can also emphasize the appearance of a control by using special effects .
For example , you can specify that a control is raised , sunken , or etched .
On a form or report , you can also specify that a control is shadowed or chiseled .
Borders .
You can set the color and width of borders of controls .
Also , you can set the line style of borders . For example , you can specify that a border consists of dashes or dots .
Appearance of text .
You can specify the font and font size for text in a control .
Also , you can make the text in a control bold , italic , or underlined .
Position .
You can move a control or align it relative to another control .
You can increase or decrease the space between controls , or you can specify that controls are evenly spaced .
About changing the properties of several controls at once
You can change property settings for a group of controls of the same type or for a group of controls of different types .
If you select controls of different types , Microsoft Access displays only the properties that are shared by the group in the property sheet .
If all the controls that you 've selected share the same property setting , that setting appears in the property sheet ; otherwise , that property box is blank .
If you change the property setting , the change is applied to all selected controls .
To select several controls at once in a data access page , you must have Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 installed on your computer .
In a form or report , the Name property never appears when more than one control is selected because control names must be unique .
About grouping data in PivotTable and PivotChart view
Grouping on intervals in PivotTable and PivotChart view
You can group items by specifying the type of interval and the size of the interval .
For example , you can group a field with date values into different months , and specify the interval as 2 , to create groups such as Jan-Feb , Mar-Apr , and so on .
The type of interval you can specify for a field depends on the data type of the field .
Numeric fields
You can group in intervals of any integer , such as 1 , 2 , 5 , 100 , and so on . For example , you can group the EmployeeID field into groups of 1-100 , 101-200 , and so on .
Date and time fields
You can group in intervals such as days , weeks , and quarters .
For example , you can group the values in the ShippedDate field into months to show data for orders shipped in January , orders shipped in February , and so on .
He wondered if the young Auster had been any better at it than he was .
Across the way , occupying the greater part of the station 's east wall , was the Kodak display photograph , with its bright unearthly colors .
The scene that month showed a street in some New England fishing village , perhaps Nantucket .
A beautiful spring light shone on the cobblestones , flowers of many colors stood in window boxes along the house fronts , and far down at the end of the street was the ocean , with its white waves and blue , blue water .
Quinn remembered visiting Nantucket with his wife long ago , in her first month of pregnancy , when his son was no more than a tiny almond in her belly .
He found it painful to think of that now , and he tried to suppress the pictures that were forming in his head .
Look at it through Auster 's eyes , he said to himself , and do n't think of anything else .
He turned his attention to the photograph again and was relieved to find his thoughts wandering to the subject of whales , to the expeditions that had set out from Nantucket in the last century , to Melville and the opening pages of Moby Dick .
From there his mind drifted off to the accounts he had read of Melville 's last years – the taciturn old man working in the New York customs house , with no readers , forgotten by everyone .
Then , suddenly , with great clarity and precision , he saw Bartleby 's window and the blank brick wall before him .
Someone tapped him on the arm , and as Quinn wheeled to meet the assault , he saw a short , silent man holding out a green and red ballpoint pen to him .
Stapled to the pen was a little white paper flag , one side of which read : This good article is the Courtesy of a DEAF MUTE .
Pay any price .
Thank you for your help .
On the other side of the flag there was a chart of the manual alphabet – LEARN TO SPEAK TO YOUR FRIENDS – that showed the hand positions for each of the twenty-six letters .
Quinn reached into his pocket and gave the man a dollar .
The deaf mute nodded once very briefly and then moved on , leaving Quinn with the pen in his hand .
It was now past five o'clock .
Quinn decided he would be less vulnerable in another spot and removed himself to the waiting room .
This was generally a grim place , filled with dust and people with nowhere to go , but now , with the rush hour at full force , it had been taken over by men and women with briefcases , books , and newspapers .
Quinn had trouble finding a seat .
After searching for two or three minutes , he finally found a place on one of the benches , wedging himself between a man in a blue suit and a plump young woman .
The man was reading the sports section of the Times , and Quinn glanced over to read the account of Mets ' loss the night before .
He had made it to the third or fourth paragraph when the man turned slowly toward him , gave him a vicious stare , and jerked the paper out of view .
After that , a strange thing happened .
Quinn turned his attention to the young woman on his right , to see if there was any reading material in that direction .
Quinn guessed her age at around twenty .
There were several pimples on her left cheek , obscured by a pimpish smear of pancake makeup , and a wad of chewing gum was crackling in her mouth .
She was , however , reading a book , a paperback with a lurid cover , and Quinn leaned over ever so slightly to his right to catch a glimpse of the title .
Against all his expectations , it was a book he himself had written – Suicide Squeeze by William Wilson , the first of the Max Work novels .
Quinn had often imagined this situation : the sudden , unexpected pleasure of encountering one of his readers .
He had even imagined the conversation that would follow : he , suavely diffident as the stranger praised the book , and then , with great reluctance and modesty , agreeing to autograph the title page , since you insist .
But now that the scene was taking place , he felt quite disappointed , even angry .
He did not like the girl sitting next to him , and it offended him that she should be casually skimming the pages that had cost him so much effort .
His impulse was to tear the book out of her hands and run across the station with it .
He looked at her face again , trying to hear the words she was sounding out in her head , watching her eyes as they darted back and forth across the page .
He must have been looking too hard , for a moment later she turned to him with an irritated expression on her face and said , You got a problem , mister ?
Quinn smiled weakly . No problem , he said .
I was just wondering if you liked the book .
The girl shrugged . I 've read better and I 've read worse .
Quinn wanted to drop the conversation right there , but something in him persisted .
Before he could get up and leave , the words were already out of his mouth . Do you find it exciting ?
The girl shrugged again and cracked her gum loudly . Sort of . There 's a part where the detective gets lost that 's kind of scary .
Is he a smart detective ?
Yeah , he 's smart . But he talks too much .
You 'd like more action ?
I guess so .
If you do n't like it , why do you go on reading ?
I do n't know . The girl shrugged once again .
It passes the time , I guess .
Anyway , it 's no big deal . It 's just a book .
He was about to tell her who he was , but then he realized that it made no difference .
The girl was beyond hope .
For five years he had kept William Wilson 's identity a secret , and he was n't about to give it away now , least of all to an imbecile stranger .
Still , it was painful , and he struggled desperately to swallow his pride .
Rather than punch the girl in the face , he abruptly stood up from his seat and walked away .
At six-thirty he posted himself in front of gate twenty-four .
The train was due to arrive in time , and from his vantage in the center of the doorway , Quinn judged that his chances of seeing Stillman were good .
He took out the photograph from his pocket and studied it again ,
paying special attention to the eyes .
He remembered having read somewhere that the eyes were the one feature of the face that never changed .
From childhood to old age they remained the same , and a man with the head to see it could theoretically look into the eyes of a boy in a photograph and recognize the same person as an old man .
Quinn had his doubts , but this was all he had to go on , his only bridge to the present .
Once again , however , Stillman 's face told him nothing .
The train pulled into the station , and Quinn felt the noise of it shoot through his body : a random , hectic din that seemed to join with his pulse , pumping his blood in raucous spurts .
His head then filled with Peter Stillman 's voice , as a barrage of nonsense words clattered against the walls of his skull .
He told himself to stay calm .
But that did little good . In spite of what he had been expecting of himself at this moment , he was excited .
The train was crowded , and as the passengers started filling the ramp and walking toward him , they quickly became a mob .
Quinn flapped the red notebook nervously against his right thigh , stood on his tiptoes , and peered into the throng .
Soon the people were surging around him .
There were men and women , children and old people , teenagers and babies , rich people and poor people , black men and white women , white men and black women , Orientals and Arabs , men in brown and gray and blue and green , women in red and white and yellow and pink , children in sneakers , children in shoes , children in cowboy boots , fat people and thin people , tall people and short people , each one different from all the others , each one irreducibly himself .
Quinn watched them all , anchored to his spot , as if his whole being had been exiled to his eyes .
Each time an elderly man approached , he braced himself for it to be Stillman .
They came and went too quickly for him to indulge in disappointment , but in each old face he seemed to find an augur of what the real Stillman would be like , and he rapidly shifted his expectations with each new face , as if the accumulation of old men was heralding the imminent arrival of Stillman himself .
For one brief instant Quinn thought , So this is what detective work is like . But other than that he thought nothing .
He watched .
Immobile among the moving crowd , he stood there and watched .
The next morning , and for many mornings to follow , Quinn posted himself on a bench in the middle of the traffic island at Broadway and 99th Street .
I wish it was . But this has nothing to do with literature .
With what , then ?
Quinn paused , looked around the room without seeing anything , and tried to start .
I 've a feeling there 's been a terrible mistake .
I came here looking for Paul Auster , the private detective .
The what ? Auster laughed , and in that laugh everything was suddenly blown to bits .
Quinn realized that he was talking nonsense .
He must just as well have asked for Chief Sitting Bull – the effect would have been no different .
The private detective , he repeated softly .
I 'm afraid you 've got the wrong Paul Auster .
You 're the only one in the book .
That might be , said Auster .
But I 'm not a detective .
Who are you then ?
What do you do ?
I 'm a writer .
A writer ? Quinn spoke the word as though it were a lament .
I 'm sorry . Auster said .
But that 's what I happen to be .
If that 's true , then there 's no hope .
The whole thing is a bad dream .
I have no idea what you 're talking about .
Quinn told him .
He began at the beginning and went through the entire story , step by step .
The pressure had been building up in him since Stillman 's disappearance that morning , and it came out of him now as a torrent of words .
He told of the phone calls for Paul Auster , of his inexplicable acceptance of the case , of his meeting with Peter Stillman , of his conversation with Virginia Stillman , of his reading Stillman 's book , of his following Stillman from Grand Central Station , of Stillman 's daily wanderings , of the carpetbag and the broken objects , of the disquieting maps that formed letters of the alphabet , of his talks with Stillman , of Stillman 's disappearance from the hotel .
When he had come to the end , he said , Do you think I 'm crazy ?
No , said Auster , who had listened attentively to Quinn 's monologue
If I had been in your place , I probably would have done the same thing .
These words came as a great relief to Quinn , as if , at long last , the burden was no longer his alone .
He felt like taking Auster in his arms and declaring his friendship for life .
You see , said Quinn , I 'm not making it up . I even have proof .
He took out his wallet and removed the five-hundred-dollar check that Virginia Stillman had written two weeks earlier .
He handed it to Auster . You see , he said .
It 's even made out to you .
Auster looked the check over carefully and nodded .
It seems to be a perfectly normal check .
Well , it 's yours , said Quinn .
I want you to have it .
I could n't possibly accept it .
It 's of no use to me . Quinn looked around the apartment and gestured vaguely .
Buy yourself some more books . Or a few toys for your kid .
This is money you 've earned .
You deserve to have it yourself . Auster paused for a moment .
There 's one thing I 'll do for you , though .
Since the check is in my name , I 'll cash it for you .
I 'll take it to my bank tomorrow morning , deposit it in my account , and give you the money when it clears .
Quinn did not say anything .
All right ? Auster asked .
Is it agreed ?
All right , said Quinn at last .
We 'll see what happens .
Auster put the check on the coffee table , as if to say the matter had been settled .
Then he leaned back on the sofa and looked Quinn in the eyes .
There 's a much more important question than the check , he said .
The fact that my name has been mixed up in this .
I do n't understand it at all .
I wonder if you 've had any trouble with your phone lately .
Wires sometimes get crossed . A person tries to call a number , and even though he dials correctly , he gets someone else .
Yes , that 's happened to me before .
But even if my phone was broken , that does n't explain the real problem .
It would tell us why the call went to you , but not why they wanted to speak to me in the first place .
Is it possible that you know the people involved ?
I 've never heard of the Stillmans .
Maybe someone wanted to play a practical joke on you .
I do n't hang around with people like that .
You never know .
But the fact is , it 's not a joke .
It 's a real case with real people .
Yes , said Quinn after a long silence .
I 'm aware of that .
They had come to the end of what they could talk about .
Beyond that point there was nothing : the random thoughts of men who knew nothing .
Quinn realized that he should be going .
He had been there almost an hour , and the time was approaching for his call to Virginia Stillman .
Nevertheless , he was reluctant to move .
The chair was comfortable , and the beer had gone slightly to his head .
This Auster was the first intelligent person he had spoken to in a long time .
He had read Quinn 's old work , he had admired it , he had been looking forward to more .
The Archbishop is really very handsome , with his full cheeks , his long clear dark-green eyes , and the short strong beard .
His church is venerable rich and beautiful .
It contains the head of Saint James the brother of John and many relics .
The house of Annas , in which Jesus was questioned and struck , is within the compound .
The church 's manuscript collection is the largest outside Soviet Armenia .
The antique tiles are gorgeous .
But all these things are in some way external .
We outsiders are not stable enough to appreciate them .
We inherit our mode of appreciation from the Victorians , from a time of safety and leisure , when dinner guests knew better than to smoke after the main course , when Levantines were Levantines and culture was still culture .
But in these days of armored attacks on Yom Kippur , of Vietnams , Watergates , Mansons , Amins , terrorist massacres at Olympic Games , what are illuminated manuscripts , what are masterpieces of wrought iron , what are holy places ?
We soon get around to contemporary matters .
A call to the telephone ;
the Archbishop excuses himself in two languages and tells us when he comes back that he has been speaking to one of his Lebanese friends calling from Cyprus or from Greece .
He sits down , saying that the influence of Yasir Arafat is evidently weakening and fading .
Arafat was unable to complete the classic guerrilla pattern and bring the masses into the struggle .
Then someone says that it ca n't be long now before the Russians write Arafat off .
They have undoubtedly recognized their failure in the Arab world and may even be preparing to reopen diplomatic relations with Israel .
Most of the dinner guests agree that Russia 's internal difficulties are so grave it may have to draw away from Syria .
Indeed , it may be forced to retreat from the Middle East and concentrate on its domestic problems .
To avoid collapse the Russians may be driven into a war with China .
Secretary-of-State Henry Kissinger has won the Middle Eastern struggle by drawing Egypt into the American camp .
He is a genius .
The Russians are in disarray , perhaps in retreat .
I have been hearing conversations like this one for half a century .
I well remember what intelligent , informed people were saying in the last years of the Weimar Republic , what they told one another in the first days after Hindenburg had brought in Hitler .
I recall table talk from the times of Leon Blum and Edouard Daladier .
I remember what people said about the Italian adventure in Ethiopia and about the Spanish Civil War and the Battle of Britain .
Such intelligent discussion has n't always been wrong .
What is wrong with it is that the discussants invariably impart their own intelligence to what they are discussing .
Later , historical studies show that what actually happened was devoid of anything like such intelligence .
It was absent from Flanders Field and from Versailles , absent when the Ruhr was taken , absent from Teheran , Yalta , Potsdam , absent from British policy at the time of the Palestine Mandate , absent before , during , and after the Holocaust .
History and politics are not at all like the notions developed by intelligent , informed people .
Tolstoi made this clear in the opening pages of War and Peace .
In Anna Scherer 's salon , the elegant guests are discussing the scandal of Napoleon and the Duc d'Enghien , and Prince Andrei says that after all there is a great difference between Napoleon the Emperor and Napoleon the private person .
There are raisons d'etat and there are private crimes .
And the talk goes on .
What is still being perpetuated in all civilized discussion is the ritual of civilized discussion itself .
Tatu agrees with the Archbishop about the Russians .
So that , as they say in Chicago , is where the smart money is .
The Vatican is the next topic and receives similar treatment .
Some Armenian prelates have joined us for coffee and take part in the discussion .
Someone observes that the Church is a worshiper of success and always follows the majorities .
See what it is doing now in the Warsaw Pact countries , it is making deals with the Communists .
Should communism sweep Italy , would the Pope move to Jerusalem ?
Rather , says one of the prelates , he would stay in Rome and become Party secretary .
And there we are , Kissinger has entirely wrecked Russia 's Middle East policy and the Pope is about to swap the Vatican for the Kremlin .
Dessert is served .
In my letter to Le Monde I had said that in the French tradition there were two attitudes toward the Jews : a revolutionary attitude which had resulted in their enfranchisement , and an anti-Semitic one .
The intellectual leaders of the Enlightenment were decidedly anti-Semitic .
I asked which of the two attitudes would prevail in twentieth-century France the century of the Dreyfus affair and of the Vichy government .
The position taken by Foreign Minister Maurice Jobert in the October War of 1973 was that the Palestinian Arabs had a natural and justified desire to " go home . "
I expressed , politely , the hope that the other attitude , the revolutionary one , would not be abandoned .
I made sure that my letter would be delivered .
Eugene Ionescu gave the editors one copy of it ; another was handed to them by Manes Sperber , the novelist .
The letter was never acknowledged .
Since 1973 , Le Monde has openly taken the side of the Arabs in their struggle with Israel .
It supports terrorists .
It is friendlier to Amin than to Rabin .
A recent review of the autobiography of a fedayeen speaks of the Israelis as colonialists .
On July 3 , 1976 , before Israel had freed the hostages at Entebbe , the paper observed with some satisfaction that Amin , " the disquieting Marshal , " maligned by everyone , had now become the support and the hope of his foolish detractors .
The great Golden Gate that will open when the Redeemer appears stands sealed .
Just beyond , the Garden of Gethsemane .
As its name indicates , it was an olive grove .
Now pines , cypresses , and eucalyptus trees grow there below the domes of the Russian Orthodox church .
Opposite it there are olives still , which Arabs are harvesting with long poles .
They hit the branches , they thresh the leaves with their sticks , and the fruit rains down .
As we go up into the Via Dolorosa , we hear an exciting jingle .
Arab boys are racing their donkeys down the hill .
You look for sleighs and frost when you hear this jingle-belling .
Instead , there are boys stern and joyous , galloping hell-bent on their donkeys toward the Lions ' Gate .

And a few days later , on the barrenness of Judea , " whitish mildew pervading whole tracts of landscape .
Village of Lepers houses facing the wall Zion .
Their park , a dung-heap .
They sit by the gates asking alms , then whine avoidance of them &amp; horror .
Wandering among the tombs till I began to think myself one of the possessed with devils . "
Anwar Sadat 's American visit .
You have to discuss this with Israelis before they will consent to talk about anything else .
An indignant librarian , a middle-aged woman whose face is so hot it is almost fragrant with indignation , demands of me in a superdistinguished all but Oxonian accent , " How do you account for it ! "
I shrug .
This is what I would say if I did answer her :
Americans love to open their hearts to foreign visitors .
These visitors are sometimes treated as if they were the heroes of an Arabian Nights ' tale .
We 'll show them how good we all are and well-meaning and generous and open-minded and evenhanded .
We will be full of emotion and the visitors will be correspondingly full of emotion , and after they have been wined and feted and dined and toasted and televised and paraded and clapped and the supplying of loans and atomic plants and military hardware has been discussed they will love us .
I trust that they will give us better love than they are getting from us , for ours is a very low-quality upward-seeping vegetable-sap sort of love , as short-lived as it is spontaneous .
As soon as they leave they are forgotten .
An old Mormon missionary in Nauvoo once gripped my knee hard as we sat side by side , and he put his arm about me and called me " Brother . "
We 'd only met ten minutes before .
He took me to his good bosom .
His eyes began to mist .
I was a prospect , an exotic prospect in old tennis shoes and a sweatshirt .
His heart opened to me .
It opened like a cuckoo clock .
But it did not give me the time of day .
" But do n't Americans know that Sadat was a Nazi ? " the librarian says .
Well , yes , well-informed people do have this information in their files .
The New York Times is sure to have it , but the Times as I see it is a government within a government It has a state department of its own , and its high councils have probably decided that it would be impolitic at this moment to call attention to Sadat 's admiration for Hitler .
I tell the lady that I have sent a copy of a eulogy of Hitler written by Sadat in 1953 to Sydney Gruson of the Times and also to Katharine Graham of The Washington Post .
" Will they print it ? " she asked .
" Difficult to guess , " I tell her .
" The Times ought to be stronger in politics than it is in literature , but who knows .
Of course it must do financial news and sports well enough .
If it covered ball games as badly as it reviews books , the fans would storm it like the Bastille .
Book readers evidently have n't got the passionate intensity of sports fans . "
What disturbs is whether Americans understand the world at all , whether they are a match for the Russians the Sadats are in themselves comparatively unimportant .
To dissident Russian writers like Lev Navrozov , the Americans can never be a match for the Russians .
He quotes from Dostoevski 's The House of the Dead a conversation between the writer and a brutal murderer , one of those criminals who fascinated him .
I have n't the book handy , so I paraphrase .
" Why are you so kind to me ? " Dostoevski asks .
And the murderer , speaking to one of the geniuses of the nineteenth century , answers , " Because you are so simple that one can not help feeling sorry for you . "
Even when he robbed Dostoevski , he pitied him as one might " a little cherub-like child . "
Navrozov , exceedingly intelligent but , to a Westerner , curiously deformed ( how could an independent intellectual in the Soviet Union escape deformity ? ) , sees us , the Americans , as children at whom the Stalins smile through their mustachios .
Perhaps there is a certain Vautrin-admiring romanticism in this .
People were arriving , and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them .
The old one sat on her chair .
Her flat cloth slippers were propped up on a foot-warmer , and a cat reposed on her lap .
She wore a starched white affair on her head , had a wart on one cheek , and silver-rimmed spectacles hung on the tip of her nose .
She glanced at me above the glasses .
The swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me .
Two youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted over , and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom .
She seemed to know all about them and about me too .
An eerie feeling came over me .
She seemed uncanny and fateful .
Often far away there I thought of these two , guarding the door of Darkness , knitting black wool as for a warm pall , one introducing , introducing continuously to the unknown , the other scrutinizing the cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned old eyes .
Ave ! Old knitter of black wool . Morituri te salutant .
Not many of those she looked at ever saw her again – not half , by a long way .
There was yet a visit to the doctor .
A simple formality assured me the secretary , with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows .
Accordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow , some clerk I suppose , – there must have been clerks in the business , though the house was as still as a house in a city of the dead , – came from somewhere up-stairs , and led me forth .
He was shabby and careless , with ink-stains on the sleeves of his jacket , and his cravat was large and billowy , under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot .
It was a little too early for the doctor , so I proposed a drink , and thereupon he developed a vein of joviality . As we sat over our vermouths he glorified the Company 's business , and by-and-by I expressed casually my surprise at him not going out there .
He became very cool and collected all at once .
I am not such a fool as I look , quoth Plato to his disciples , he said sententiously , emptied his glass with great resolution , and we rose .
The old doctor felt my pulse , evidently thinking of something else the while .
Good , good for there , he mumbled , and then with a certain eagerness asked me whether I would let him measure my head .
Rather surprised , I said Yes , when he produced a thing like calipers and got the dimensions back and front and every way , taking notes carefully .
He was an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine , with his feet in slippers , and I thought him a harmless fool .
I always ask leave , in the interests of science , to measure the crania of those going out there , he said .
And when they come back , too ? I asked .
Oh , I never see them , he remarked ; ' and , moreover , the changes take place inside , you know .
He smiled , as if at some quiet joke .
So you are going out there .
Famous . Interesting too .
He gave me a searching glance , and made another note .
Ever any madness in your family ? ' he asked , in a matter-of-fact tone .
I felt very annoyed .
Is that question in the interests of science too ?
It would be , he said , without taking notice of my irritation , ' interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals , on the spot , but ...
Are you an alienist ? I interrupted .
Every doctor should be – a little , answered that original , imperturbably .
' I have a little theory which you Messieurs who go out there must help me to prove .
This is my share in the advantages my country shall reap from the possession of such a magnificent dependency .
The mere wealth I leave to others .
Pardon my questions , but you are the first Englishman coming under my observation ... .
' I hastened to assure him I was not in the least typical .
If I were , said I , I would n't be talking like this with you .
What you say is rather profound , and probably erroneous , he said , with a laugh .
Avoid irritation more than exposure to the sun .
Adieu .
How do you English say , eh ? Good-by .
Ah ! Good-by .
Adieu .
In the tropics one must before everything keep calm .
' ... He lifted a warning forefinger ... .
' Du calme , du calme .
Adieu .
One thing more remained to do – say good-by to my excellent aunt .
I found her triumphant .
I had a cup of tea – the last decent cup of tea for many days – and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you would expect a lady 's drawing-room to look , we had a long quiet chat by the fireside .
In the course of these confidences it became quite plain to me I had been represented to the wife of the high dignitary , and goodness knows to how many more people besides , as an exceptional and gifted creature – a piece of good fortune for the Company – a man you do n't get hold of every day .
Good heavens !
and I was going to take charge of a two-penny-halfpenny river-steamboat with a penny whistle attached !
It appeared , however , I was also one of the Workers , with a capital – you know . Something like an emissary of light , something like a lower sort of apostle .
There had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and talk just about that time , and the excellent woman , living right in the rush of all that humbug , got carried off her feet .
She talked about ' weaning those ignorant millions from their horrid ways ' , till , upon my word , she made me quite uncomfortable .
Another mine on the cliff went off , followed by a slight shudder of the soil under my feet .
The work was going on .
The work !
And this was the place where some of the helpers had withdrawn to die .
They were dying slowly – it was very clear .
They were not enemies , they were not criminals , they were nothing earthly now , – nothing but black shadows of disease and starvation , lying confusedly in the greenish gloom .
Brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality of time contracts , lost in uncongenial surroundings , fed on unfamiliar food , they sickened , became inefficient , and were then allowed to crawl away and rest .
These moribund shapes were free as air – and nearly as thin .
I began to distinguish the gleam of eyes under the trees .
Then , glancing down , I saw a face near my hand .
The black bones reclined at full length with one shoulder against the tree , and slowly the eyelids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me , enormous and vacant , a kind of blind , white flicker in the depths of the orbs , which died out slowly .
The man seemed young – almost a boy – but you know with them it 's hard to tell .
I found nothing else to do but to offer him one of my good Swede 's ship 's biscuits I had in my pocket .
The fingers closed slowly on it and held – there was no other movement and no other glance .
He had tied a bit of white worsted round his neck – Why ?
Where did he get it ?
Was it a badge – an ornament – a charm – a propitiatory act ?
Was there any idea at all connected with it ?
It looked startling round his black neck , this bit of white thread from beyond the seas .
Near the same tree two more bundles of acute angles sat with their legs drawn up .
One , with his chin propped on his knees , stared at nothing , in an intolerable and appalling manner : his brother phantom rested its forehead , as if overcome with a great weariness ; and all about others were scattered in every pose of contorted collapse , as in some picture of a massacre or a pestilence .
While I stood horror-struck , one of these creatures rose to his hands and knees , and went off on all-fours towards the river to drink .
He lapped out of his hand , then sat up in the sunlight , crossing his shins in front of him , and after a time let his woolly head fall on his breastbone .
I did n't want any more loitering in the shade , and I made haste towards the station .
When near the buildings I met a white man , in such an unexpected elegance of get-up that in the first moment I took him for a sort of vision .
I saw a high starched collar , white cuffs , a light alpaca jacket , snowy trousers , a clear necktie , and varnished boots . No hat .
Hair parted , brushed , oiled , under a green-lined parasol held in a big white hand .
He was amazing , and had a penholder behind his ear .
I shook hands with this miracle , and I learned he was the Company 's chief accountant , and that all the bookkeeping was done at this station .
He had come out for a moment , he said , ' to get a breath of fresh air . '
The expression sounded wonderfully odd , with its suggestion of sedentary desk-life .
I would n't have mentioned the fellow to you at all , only it was from his lips that I first heard the name of the man who is so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time .
Moreover , I respected the fellow .
Yes ; I respected his collars , his vast cuffs , his brushed hair .
His appearance was certainly that of a hairdresser 's dummy ; but in the great demoralization of the land he kept up his appearance .
That 's backbone .
His starched collars and got-up shirt-fronts were achievements of character .
He had been out nearly three years ; and , later on , I could not help asking him how he managed to sport such linen .
He had just the faintest blush , and said modestly , I 've been teaching one of the native women about the station .
It was difficult . She had a distaste for the work .
This man had verily accomplished something .
And he was devoted to his books , which were in apple-pie order .
Everything else in the station was in a muddle , – heads , things , buildings .
Strings of dusty niggers with splay feet arrived and departed ; a stream of manufactured goods , rubbishy cottons , beads , and brass-wire set into the depths of darkness , and in return came a precious trickle of ivory .
I had to wait in the station for ten days – an eternity .
I lived in a hut in the yard , but to be out of the chaos I would sometimes get into the accountant 's office .
It was built of horizontal planks , and so badly put together that , as he bent over his high desk , he was barred from neck to heels with narrow strips of sunlight .
There was no need to open the big shutter to see .
It was hot there too ; big flies buzzed fiendishly , and did not sting , but stabbed .
I sat generally on the floor , while , of faultless appearance ( and even slightly scented ) , perching on a high stool , he wrote , he wrote .
Sometimes he stood up for exercise .
When a truckle-bed with a sick man ( some invalided agent from up-country ) was put in there , he exhibited a gentle annoyance .
The groans of this sick person , he said , distract my attention .
And without that it is extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors in this climate .
One day he remarked , without lifting his head , ' In the interior you will no doubt meet Mr. Kurtz . '
On my asking who Mr. Kurtz was , he said he was a first-class agent ; and seeing my disappointment at this information , he added slowly , laying down his pen , ' He is a very remarkable person . '
Further questions elicited from him that Mr. Kurtz was at present in charge of a trading post , a very important one , in the true ivory-country , at ' the very bottom of there .
Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together ... .
He began to write again .
The sick man was too ill to groan .
The flies buzzed in a great peace .
Suddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and a great tramping of feet .
Fourthly , do not say we were not available !
It would certainly be counterproductive to make an offer , as some have already tried , when the Russians want nothing to do with it .
In our proposals in relation to Agenda 2000 we considered the probable future trend of competition between pigmeat and beef .
Should we find at any point that this is not the case , we will take the appropriate steps .
I must admit I see the question of a world market orientation rather differently from the way it was presented a moment ago .
Joint motion for a resolution on the crisis in the pigmeat sector
We favour a reform involving the alignment of prices to world market prices and a reduction in export refunds .
Finally , I should like to point out here the significance of a proposal put forward by our colleague Edouard des Places .
I see this proposal as establishing some sort of precedent .
It was quite a poignant fact that I was away on that particular Friday .
We need foreign investors in places such as Telford , north Shropshire , Hereford , Ross-on-Wye and Wyre Forest .
I would certainly not want farmers in countries that do not want to join the euro to be penalised .
The 2.6 -% margin of fluctuation is nothing new ; it already exists within the present system and is already being applied .
The flat-rate approach produces more risk of overcompensation , which is why we have set the margin at 2.6 -% .
A strong euro will therefore penalise European agricultural exports .
Under these conditions , what will the future of the rural areas of Europe be like as a consequence ?
We in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development feel that this form of production should be encouraged .
Too little is being done in this area . More needs to be done , but we must avoid creating more bureaucracy .
I have nothing against putting quality goods on the world market when it is a matter of competition .
Firstly , it proposes the adoption of a regulation improving the transparency and authenticity of quality marks .
It then proposes the creation of a European quality mark based on respect for the environmental criteria for production .
The market in agricultural products is therefore no longer linked exclusively to price , but to the region .
We in Parliament would like to add a third category covering organic products that also comply with environmental and animal protection criteria .
I was recently in Poland for the Joint Parliamentary Committee .
But that is precisely why we first need a clear strategy .
At this stage , it still seems a little too soon to take a final position on this question .
We support the introduction of a European quality mark , which takes account of animal welfare and the environment .
Secondly , we can not support proposals for the split in funding or criteria in relation to the new Structural Fund regulation .
We welcome the introduction of conditional clauses for the second payment .
The results of the fourth phase of the Objective 2 programme , whose priority is job creation , are relatively pleasing .
Thank you , Mr Donnay .
Mr Escola Hernando is speaking for the first time in this House .
Mr President , I should merely like to answer Mr Kellett-Bowman in one sentence .
The Chair has already stated that the proposal was made in accordance with the Rules , so there are no grounds for changing anything .
Our group has tabled several amendments in this direction .
The programme has also contributed to the activities of 50000 creative or performing artists and other specialists in the cultural sector .
The decisions were adopted unanimously .
The joint debate is closed .
That concludes Parliament 's agenda .
Adjournment of the session
Yesterday it was my privilege and pleasure to be permitted two minutes ' speaking time in this House .
It was obviously out of excitement at this great event that I forgot to sign the register .
Ladies and gentlemen , it is a good thing that the details of Members ' attendance are corrected .
That is wrong .
This item has been correctly placed on the agenda and will be put to the vote at 12 noon today .
The deadline expires today , so if we do not vote , we shall miss the opportunity to deliver our opinion .
Preparing a Union-wide harmonising directive on as complex a matter as energy is certainly a complicated business .
I believe that the Commission 's initial approach was wise , because the problem calls for countless exceptions to the general rule .
Madam President , our colleague , Mr Cox , has done some excellent work on the Commission 's proposal .
The Green Group fully agrees with Mr Spencer that we must preserve this proposal for a CO2 tax .
The taxes will end up in the German Treasury instead of the Danish Treasury .
Nonetheless , I should like to take up two points which are mentioned in the Environment Committee 's report .
I should also like to know how you view the timing .
This is legislation requiring a unanimous vote in the Council , which is usually a guarantee of inaction .
This indexing also includes the notion of an accelerator .
In other words , there is a conflict between the parafiscal and fiscal aims ; you can not have your cake and eat it .
That technological effort would be penalised and competitiveness on the international field jeopardised .
In light of this situation , we find it difficult to accept a number of unilateral proposals that were put forward .
It is therefore unacceptable to compel the Member States to apply increases that are actually above the rate of inflation .
You can regulate the market , but you can not regulate nature , the weather and the harvest .
In one amendment , there is a call for the inclusion of pure and simple renewal of vineyards in the restructuring measures .
Nevertheless , we want to limit the Council regulations to general provisions and to cover the remaining provisions in implementing regulations .
Everyone will therefore understand why I am rejecting them .
I would like to start with the Convention on third-country nationals , which is certainly the more complex legislative project .
The mere offer of a job was to be sufficient to justify immigration rights .
They have not all been met , but a great many have .
Secondly , I believe that it is time for the European Parliament to set an example .
On the other hand , these initial criteria should also include provisions allowing for the list to be abolished .
Such a situation is unacceptable .
I am all for thought being given to this and for seeking solutions .
We must help them to improve their border security .
It is the whole political class that is being questioned about the way in which it must take up these challenges .
Finally , I should like to say that the policies at the centre of our debate are part of an overall picture .
I would also like to say something about the two amendments tabled by my group .
We want things to be regulated properly so that the problem can be brought under control .
He has consistently linked immigration with unemployment , insecurity and criminality , as if evil always comes from elsewhere .
I would really like to know how you can escape into Europe .
We have been discussing this subject ever since I have been in Parliament .
I hope they will be rejected because they are really the epitome of what Parliament is not able to do .
Consequently , I had hoped to be able to count on a clear expression of support from the European Parliament .
Naturally the Commission will do its best to ensure that progress is made .
The regulation that was annulled was based on Article 100c of the Maastricht Treaty .
The debate is closed .
I thought it appropriate to retable at second reading three of the 12 amendments rejected by the Council .
I have to admit that I had serious misgivings during the first reading of the directive .
Perhaps we are only further complicating a matter which should really have left Parliament as quickly as possible once a decision had been reached .
Chemicals are still on our agenda in the EU .
There has been excellent cooperation on this highly technical proposal .
Thank goodness we have finally reached the last stage before adoption .
Parliament agreed to urgent procedure for 22 March
Amendment of the Rules of Procedure
They leave space and gaps to fill in .
This new legally binding vote is highlighted in the revision of the Rules by describing it as the election of the Commission .
They include provisions for dealing with the new High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
I shall not go into details on the High Representative , as his or her function has already been extensively debated .
Finally , now that I am discussing resources , new technologies and speaking time , my own speaking time has elapsed .
The second part makes it clear that benefits of a value greater than ECU 100 must be declared .
The report is also imprudent in introducing issues not included in the mandate given by the Conference of Presidents .
The opinion must be expressed when the vote on the full text is taken in committee .
But that is not really my problem .
What I criticise is the spirit underlying these amendments .
This is the last rule in our Rules of Procedure and it concerns the annexes .
Let me begin by saying that I do not intend to talk about my own report .
Notwithstanding this , we shall certainly consider the suggestions put forward by the Socialist Group .
The first concerns the proposal that would prevent political groups being formed of Members from one country only .
The second issue is that of incentives .
I believe it is workable , though it may be somewhat complicated .
I am no fanatical defender of profits for pharmaceutical industry multinationals .
We support Professor Cabrol 's attempt to get things moving and put the uncertainties behind us .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the present proposal for a regulation is certainly to be welcomed .
of course we can do so directly through support for research , and we shall continue to do so in future .
But we also want to create a range of additional incentives , for instance through the ten-year market exclusivity right .
The Member States would have to do so .
I am very glad that some Members also spoke in favour of a special committee , during the debate .
But then you must remember the aim of our proposal .
That is why we want to support research rather than make it more difficult .
We believe that is a risk we should not necessarily take on .
For by definition an orphan drug is precisely a drug that offers very limited prospects of making a profit .
The stale cool air of the room had heated ; yet weariness receded , his head was left high and dry of it .
There was silence and then he heard that there were voices in the silence droning somewhere , breaking off for breath , laughing – not softly , but softened by being almost out of earshot .
not quite .
A voice separated , wound nearer , there was the starting up of a hiss ( a hose , he thought ) and he made out a word : not just as a particular combination of articulated sounds , but a meaning :
the compound word for this phrase , in the language that was spoken round the capital , and that he had never really known well .
He got up and went over to the main house for a bath .
The sun in the garden was burning , dazzling , seizing .
In the bathroom flies were buzzing themselves to death against the windowpanes .
Roly was a bachelor and his house was the particular mixture of tranquil luxury and unchangeable dreariness that is a condition of households where white men live indulged in the sole charge of black male servants .
The cistern of the lavatory drizzled into the pan constantly and could n't be flushed properly , and the towels were stiff as a dress-shirt ( Olivia had taken years to get people to learn to rinse the soap out of the washing ) , but an old fellow in a cook 's hat put tea under the trees for him and carried off his crumpled suit to be pressed without being asked .
A youth was cutting the tough grass with a length of iron bent at the end .
Coarse and florid shrubs , hibiscus with its big flowers sluttish with pollen and ants and poinsettia oozing milky secretion , bloomed giving a show of fecundity to the red , poor soil running baked bald under the grass , beaten slimy by the rains under the trees , and friable only where ants had digested it and made little crusty tunnels .
A rich stink of dead animal rose self-dispersed , like a gas , every now and then as he drank his tea , and he got up and looked around , as he had done so many times before , and with as little success , to see if a rat or mole were rotting somewhere .
Whatever it was could never be found ; it was the smell of growth , they had long ago decided , at Gala , the process of decay and regeneration so accelerated , brought so close together that it produced the reek of death-and-life , all at once .
He strolled to the limits of the garden and climbed through the barbed-wire fence , but the grasses and thornbush on the other side ( Dando 's place was eight miles out of town ) were too entangled for walking where there was no path .
He listened to the bush and had the old feeling , in the bush , of being listened for .
There were – or used to be – leopards on the outskirts of the town ; Dando had once had his dog taken .
He walked a hundred yards or so up the road , and , meeting a man on a bicycle , greeted him in the language that had come back to him as he lay in the room .
At six Roland Dando came home .
He gazed anxiously from the car as if , despite the telephone call , he were not sure if Bray had been safely received , but once he set eyes on him behaved as if they had seen each other a week ago .
He was indiscreet , like many people who live alone , and brought back with him from the town – a child bulging with favours from a party – all the anecdotes and gossip of the Independence celebrations , producing , in a clinging fluff of supposition and rumour , bits and pieces of real information and opinion about Mweta 's position and the sort of team he had gathered around him .
Another tray came out under the trees , this time with whisky and gin .
An old black Labrador with corns on his elbows stood slowly swinging his tail before Dando as he talked .
Jason would n't bring home any golden fleece , believe you me ( Jason Malenga was the new Minister of Finance ) ; no , it was n't a bad thing that the British Chief of Police was n't being kept on , people always judged by the Congo , the idiots , but the African deputy , Aaron Onabu , was perfectly capable of taking over from that dodderer anyway ; Talisman Gwenzi was first class , and a real Mweta man , David Sambata was an unknown quantity for Agriculture
Dando pulled ticks off the dog 's neck and burst them under his shoe while he drank and dealt out judgements .
Out of a kind of jealousy of the new young men from Britain and America who were so careful to show their lack of colour-feeling by avoiding tainted words and addressing people by polite forms , he ecklessly used the old settler vocabulary that reflected an attitude he had had no part of , ever .
Roly Dando could say what he liked :
Roly Dando had n't discovered the blacks as his fellows only yesterday .
Of course , Mweta has to hand out a job to everybody .
Every pompous jackass from the bush who filled his pipe with tobacco bought with dues from the local party branch .
They 're all heroes , you know , heroes of the struggle .
Struggle my arse .
Edward Shinza 's one of the few who did his stretch and got his head split open that time by Her Majesty 's brave boys , and where 's he ... back in the Bashi Flats among his old wives , for all I know , no one even mentions his name .
But Shinza 's here for the Independence ceremony ?
Roly glared .
Nobody gives a damn where he is .
But he is in town , now ?
I do n't know where the hell he may be .
You mean Edward 's not going to take part in the celebrations ?
That 's not possible .
He 's not come up to town ?
You can see he has n't been given a cabinet post .
I do n't suppose he 's going to turn up for the honour of standing in the crowd and waving a flag , eh ?
But that 's ridiculous , Roly .
You know Shinza .
He knows what he wants .
I had the impression he 'll be ambassador to U.N.
Give time for Mweta to shine on his own for a bit , and any tension between them to die down .
Of course he should have got Foreign Affairs .
But that 's between the two of them .
You might ask Mweta , if you get a chance to talk to him , ask him if he is n't going to find a piddling little job somewhere , something with a decent label to it , for poor old Shinza , he was banging on the Colonial Secretary 's door with a panga while Mweta was a snotty picannin singing hymns up at the mission school .
Dando glowered pettishly over his third or fourth gin and ginger beer .
He was given to putting himself on strange mixtures .
He would drink one for several months and then switch , for similar good reasons ( it was more digestible , it was less likely to produce an after-thirst ) to another .
Oh Mweta 's not like that .
You know Mweta .
I know Mweta .
But there 's the President , now .
If there 's a father of the state , it 's got to be him or no one .
I certainly had the impression whatever tension there was had eased up , last time I saw Mweta in London .
Yes , poor old Shinza , that 's what everyone says .
Poor old Dando .
Dando did not explain the shift of reference .
Perhaps he simply remarked upon his own getting older ;
undoubtedly he looked older .
His small nose showed unexpectedly beaky now that the skin had sunk on either side .
Bray had a lot of questions , not all of them kind , to ask about other people .
Some of the answers were extraordinary ;
the two men quickened to the exchange of astonishment , ironic amusement , and ( on Dando 's part ) scornful indignation with which he told and Bray learned of the swift about-face by which some white people turned a smile on the new regime , while others had already packed up and left the country .
Sir Reginald himself will present Mweta with a buta-wood lectern and silver inkstand , it 's down for Tuesday afternoon .
Dando was gleeful .
Sir Reginald Harvey was president of the consortium of the three mining concessionaire companies , and it was common knowledge that , as a personal friend of Redvers Ledley , the most unpopular governor the territory had ever had , he had influenced the governor to outlaw the miners ' union at a time when Mweta and Shinza were using it to promote the independence movement .
There was a famous newspaper interview where he had called Mweta that golliwog from Gala , raising its unruly and misguided head in the nursery of industrial relations in this young country .
It 's enough to make your hair stand on end , said Dando ; and enjoyed the effect .
The People 's Independence Party , at the time , had taken Harvey 's remark as an insulting reference to Mweta 's hair ; he still had it all , and it certainly would be in evidence on Tuesday .
Bray repeated what had been said to him at the airport that morning – that some of the white people still living in the capital would be more at home down South , in Rhodesia or South Africa .
Ras Asahe meant the whites –
all know that after the end of the year they 'll be on contract , and that means they 'll be replaced in three years .
not that they ever made an effort .
Sheltered employment all these years , what d' you expect ?
You do n't need ideas , you do n't need to move out of your chair , you simply go on producing a noise out of the magic box to keep the natives quiet – and now , boom , it 's all gone , including the only incentive they ever had , their pension .
They 're pathetic , man ;
certainly they have n't much to offer when they look for jobs with the BBC .
They 're just not going to find any .
They want to go , they 're longing to , you can see they ca n't stand the sight of your face when you 're working together ... which makes things very pleasant , you can imagine ...
A slim little white girl slipped between them and took up Ras Asahe 's hand with the gold-metal watch-bracelet as if it were some possession she had put down ...
Save me from Daddy Dando .
I could give you a dozen examples of the sort of thing that happens – the ceremony this afternoon : like a horse-race , man – the arrangements were exactly what they used to use for the charity Christmas Handicap , what else do they know ?
Suggest what you like , they just talk it away into the cigarette smoke , nobody even listens .
The girl was there in their conversation like a photograph come upon lying between the pages of a book ; Bray was not sure whether she was child or woman : thin collar-bones , a long neck with a face hardly wider , pale and sallow , a big , thin , unpainted mouth , black hair and glittering , sorrowful black eyes .
She wore a dress made of Congo cloth .
Suppose at the end of the year they were not put on contract ?
What about the golden handshake – would n't it be cheaper , in the end ?
not if there 's no preparation of replacements being done in the meantime .
I tried two years ago to initiate a pilot scheme to send local people away for training in broadcasting techniques –
If I had to take over the English-language services tomorrow , you know what I 'd have to do it with a bunch of Lambala and speakers from the vernacular sections and some refugee school-teachers from South Africa .
The girl sat and saw nothing , like an animal out of breath , holed up against danger .
Bray had to rise to be introduced to a big woman marking time on the edge of the dancers with the American , Curtis Pettigrew : she was a West African whom Timothy Odara had married since Bray saw him last ..
She spoke with an American intonation , too , and in her flamboyant national dress , dragged round her as if snatched straight from the brilliant bolt on a shop counter , she seemed in every way twice the size of the local African women , who were usually kept at home , and showed it .
Pettigrew was hailed by someone , and Bray and the woman were left facing each other like the dancers ;
she put her hand on his arm .
While they moved off , she said , Guess what my name is ?
Same as yours , I believe .
But they call me James .
I should damn well hope so .
Well , I 've picked someone my own size at last tonight .
We could just sweep the others off the floor .
She maintained contact all round her as they danced , talking over his shoulder to this one , putting out a broad calloused brown foot in a gold sandal to nudge that one in the calf .
Get her to sing , Dando called out proudly .
not tonight , Dandy-Roly I 'm on my best behaviour .
Would it embarrass Evelyn if Evelyn sang ? she asked Bray .
not in the least .
What sort of thing ?
Well , what 'd you think ?
What do I look as if I 'd sing ?
She had the self-confidence of a woman of dynamic ugliness .
A snort of pleasure :
Go on !
I 've got a voice like a bullfrog .
It 's terrible when I sing the old chants from home but it 's not so bad in English – English is such a rough-sounding language anyway .
Vivien Bayley 's urgent face took up conversation in passing , ... that 's Hjalmar Wentz 's daughter ... you were sitting with .
The Oriental-looking little girl with Ras ?
Yes , lovely creature , is n't she ?
Margot would only let her come if I promised to keep her wholesomely occupied .
You did n't leave her with Ras ?
He moved his shoulders helplessly .
The dancers were falling back round a Polish agriculturalist who was teaching a gangling Englishman and two young Africans an Eastern European peasant dance .
The Congolese band had no idea what music would do , and produced a stomping crescendo ; then one of the Poles played the piano , and Neil Bayley moved in on the drums .
The undergraduate form of self-expression that emerges where Englishmen want to give themselves to celebration imposed itself for a while .
Someone left , and reappeared with another case of champagne .
The wine was warm , but an early-hours-of-the-morning rain came out like sweat , and coolness blew in on necks and faces .
Later the Odara woman sang the new national anthem in a beautiful contralto , her big belly trembling under the robe .
The young bachelors romped and the tousled girls , passing close by , or smiling suddenly at people they were n't aware of , gave up the scent of cosmetics and perfume heated on their bodies .
Then there was breakfast at the Bayleys' ; a thinning of faces , but some had kept reappearing all through the night in the changing light .
They said good night to each other in the bright slanting sun and the Bayley children were already out on the grass in their pyjamas , riding bicycles .
In a few days the faces had lost the stylized , apparition-quality of that first night , the night of the Independence Ball , and become , if not familiar , at least expected .
A young woman was in and out the Bayleys ' house , sometimes adding to , sometimes carrying off with her the many children who played there .
She was Rebecca , Rebecca Edwards , like a big , untidy schoolgirl in her cotton shirt and sandals , the car key on her forefinger jingling harassedly .
She was always being sent to pick up people when arrangements went wrong ;
she came for Bray one afternoon in an old station wagon littered with sweet-papers , odd socks , and Dinky toys .
It was she who had given her glass to him that night at the Independence party ;
the Pole who had danced the gazatska became the man with whom he gravitated to a quiet corner so that they could talk about the curious grammar-structure of Gala and the Lambala group of languages .
The atmosphere at the parties was what he thought it must have been at gatherings described in nineteenth-century Russian novels .
Children swept in and out , belligerently pleasure-seeking .
Babies slept in dark rooms .
Food was cooked by many hands .
Invitations were measured only by how long the beer and wine lasted out .
He felt himself the middle-aged relative , a man of vague repute come from afar to the wedding and drawn helplessly and not unenjoyably into everything .
It was , in a curious way , an extension of what he was at the official receptions where many people had little idea who the white stranger was , sitting in a modest place of honour ;
and once , at a press dinner Mweta 's reference to the presence of one of the fairy godmothers ' who had been present at the christening and had returned for the coming-of-age of the State went , thank God , unnoticed as a reference to himself .
It became his Independence story ; as the story of the cigarette company 's helicopter was Neil Bayley 's , related again and again while the private drama between husband and wife that had made it pass unremarked at the time was quite dropped out of the context .
Bray asked everywhere about Edward Shinza ; certainly he was not in evidence at any official occasion .
Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry .
Harry was n't listening .
He made a grab for the letters , but Dobby jumped out of reach .
Ah , sir , this is a danger you must not face !
Give me my friends ' letters !
Before Harry could move , Dobby had darted to the bedroom door , pulled it open – and sprinted down the stairs .
Mouth dry , stomach lurching , Harry sprang after him , trying not to make a sound .
He jumped the last six stairs , landing catlike on the hall carpet , looking around for Dobby .
Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear .
Aunt Petunia 's masterpiece of a pudding , the mountain of cream and sugared violets , was floating up near the ceiling .
On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby .
Harry Potter must say he 's not going back to school –
Dobby gave him a tragic look .
The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash .
Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered .
With a crack like a whip , Dobby vanished .
There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry , rigid with shock , covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia 's pudding .
At first , it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over ( Just our nephew – very disturbed meeting strangers upsets him , so we kept him upstairs )
He shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room , promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left , and handed him a mop .
Aunt Petunia dug some ice-cream out of the freezer and Harry , still shaking , started scrubbing the kitchen clean .
Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal – if it had n't been for the owl .
Aunt Petunia was just handing round a box of after-dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window , dropped a letter on Mrs Mason 's head and swooped out again .
Mrs Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house , shouting about lunatics .
Mr Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes , and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke .
Harry stood in the kitchen , clutching the mop for support as Uncle Vernon advanced on him , a demonic glint in his tiny eyes .
Harry took it .
It did not contain birthday greetings .
Dear Mr Potter ,
We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine .
As you know , underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school , and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school ( Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery , 1875 , Paragraph C ) .
We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non-magical community ( Muggles ) is a serious offence , under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks ' Statute of Secrecy .
Enjoy your holidays !
Yours sincerely , Mafalda Hopkirk
IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE
Harry looked up from the letter and gulped .
He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog , all his teeth bared .
Well , I 've got news for you , boy . I 'm locking you up you 're never going back to that school . never . and if you try and magic yourself out – they 'll expel you !
And laughing like a maniac , he dragged Harry back upstairs .
Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word .
The following morning , he paid a man to fit bars on Harry 's window .
He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door , so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day .
They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening .
Otherwise , he was locked in his room around the clock .
Three days later , the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting and Harry could n't see any way out of his situation .
He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him .
What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it ?
Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low .
Now that the Dursleys knew they were n't going to wake up as fruitbats , he had lost his only weapon .
Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts , but the way things were going , he 'd probably starve to death anyway .
The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia 's hand appeared , pushing a bowl of tinned soup into the room .
Harry , whose insides were aching with hunger , jumped off his bed and seized it .
The soup was stone cold , but he drank half of it in one gulp .
Then he crossed the room to Hedwig 's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray .
She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust .
He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed , somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup .
Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks , what would happen if he did n't turn up at Hogwarts ?
Would someone be sent to see why he had n't come back ?
Would they be able to make the Dursleys let him go ?
The room was growing dark .
Exhausted , stomach rumbling , mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions , Harry fell into an uneasy sleep .
There was a big photograph on the front of a very good-looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes .
As always in the wizarding world , the photograph was moving ; the wizard , who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart , kept winking cheekily up at them all .
Mrs Weasley beamed down at him .
Do n't be so ridiculous , Fred , said Mrs Weasley , her cheeks rather pink .
Yawning and grumbling , the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry behind them .
The garden was large , and in Harry 's eyes , exactly what a garden should be .
The Dursleys would n't have liked it – there were plenty of weeds , and the grass needed cutting – but there were gnarled trees all around the walls , plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flowerbed and a big green pond full of frogs .
There was a violent scuffling noise , the peony bush shuddered and Ron straightened up .
This is a gnome , he said grimly .
It was certainly nothing like Father Christmas .
It was small and leathery-looking , with a large , knobbly , bald head exactly like a potato .
Ron held it at arm 's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet ; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside-down .
Seeing the shocked look on Harry 's face , Ron added , It does n't hurt them – you 've just got to make them really dizzy so they ca n't find their way back to the gnomeholes .
He let go of the gnome 's ankles : it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge .
Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes .
He decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge , but the gnome , sensing weakness , sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry 's finger and he had a hard job shaking it off until –
The air was soon thick with flying gnomes .
The moment they know the de-gnoming 's going on they storm up to have a look .
Soon , the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line , their little shoulders hunched .
Just then , the front door slammed .
He 's back ! said George .
They hurried through the garden and back into the house .
Mr Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed .
He was a thin man , going bald , but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children 's .
He was wearing long green robes which were dusty and travel-worn .
Mr Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed .
Find anything , Dad ? said Fred eagerly .
Just Muggle-baiting , sighed Mr Weasley .
of course , it 's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking – they 'll insist they just keep losing it .
Mrs Weasley had appeared , holding a long poker like a sword .
Mr Weasley 's eyes jerked open .
He stared guiltily at his wife .
Yes , Arthur , cars , said Mrs Weasley , her eyes flashing .
Mr Weasley blinked .
Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed !
He looked around , saw Harry , and jumped .
Very pleased to meet you , Ron 's told us so much about –
I – I mean , he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs Weasley 's eyes , that – that was very wrong , boys – very wrong indeed
They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase , which zigzagged its way up through the house .
On the third landing , a door stood ajar .
Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap .
They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it , saying Ronald 's Room .
Harry stepped in , his head almost touching the sloping ceiling , and blinked .
It was like walking into a furnace : nearly everything in Ron 's room seemed to be a violent shade of orange : the bedspread , the walls , even the ceiling .
Then Harry realised that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards , all wearing bright orange robes , carrying broomsticks , and waving energetically .
Ron 's school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner , next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs , the Mad Muggle .
Ron 's magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the window-sill , next to his fat grey rat , Scabbers , who was snoozing in a patch of sun .
Harry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window .
In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking , one by one , back through the Weasleys hedge .
Then he turned to look at Ron , who was watching him almost nervously , as though waiting for his opinion .
Not like that room you had with the Muggles .
Ron 's ears went pink .
Life at The Burrow was as different as possible from life in Privet Drive .
The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered ; the Weasleys house burst with the strange and unexpected .
The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet , and small explosions from Fred and George 's bedroom were considered perfectly normal .
What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron 's , however , was n't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul : it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him .
Mrs Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal .
Mr Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles , asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked .
Ingenious , really , how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic .
Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at The Burrow .
He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr and Mrs Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table .

Please rise , then , for this minute 's silence .
( The House rose and observed a minute 's silence ) .
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam , who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago .
Would it be appropriate for you , Madam President , to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament 's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation ?
Yes , Mr Evans , I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility .
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually .
Thank you , Mr Segni , I shall do so gladly .
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia , too , access to environmental information is a constitutional right .
We know , and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed , including specifically during the last plenary part - session of last year , that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings .
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well .
Mrs Plooij - Van Gorsel , I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors ' meeting on Wednesday .
Why has there been no fire drill , either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings ?
Why are there no fire instructions ?
Why are no - smoking areas not enforced ?
Mrs Lynne , you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done .
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors , and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on .
Madam President , Mrs Díez González and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice - President , Mrs De Palacio , which appeared in a Spanish newspaper .
I would ask that they reconsider , since this is not the case .
Mr Berenguer Fuster , we shall check all this .
I admit that , at present , the matter seems to be somewhat confused .
Today 's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there .
So Parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority .
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo .
Madam President , the presentation of the Prodi Commission 's political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi , who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech .
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents , that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma .
According to its President , it is in a position to do so .
My Group believes that since a Parliament is meant to listen , debate and reflect , there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that , if the Commission is ready to do so , we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens .
on the pretext that there is no text , on the one hand , the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and , on the other hand , there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based .
( Applause from the PSE Group ) .
( Parliament rejected the request , with 164 votes for , 166 votes against and 7 abstentions ) .
My vote was " in favour " .
There is no room for amendments .
I would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group .
This is an important matter .
Madam President , I do not wish to reopen the debate , but I had also asked for the floor , to comment on Mr Barón Crespo 's motion .
You did not call me either .
When we adopt the Minutes for today 's sitting tomorrow , then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments .
Mr Cox , Mr Hänsch , would this be acceptable to you ?
If your ruling is that I can not give an explanation of vote , I accept that but accept with reservations .
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted , then we may correct them , if necessary .
( The order of business was adopted thus amended ) .
Madam President , we can not and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads , but also on our railways and waterways , not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster .
In fact , all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province .
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards .
I should like to address one final point .
We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that , where transport safety in Europe is concerned , there is still much more to be done .
Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently :
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible .
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety .
Madam President , I would like to make a few comments .
I would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the Commission for the proposal it has submitted .
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here , with all the obvious risks that this entails .
Furthermore , it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium , Finland , but also in Japan has shown that 50 % of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment .
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned , in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year .
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present , especially with smaller companies , as these can not afford safety advisors .
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which causes problems .
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses .
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period .
Madam President , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so .
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks , known and unknown , for employees and the social environment .
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements .
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive , 95 / 35 / EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which , though technical , are nonetheless of very great significance for safety .
Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998 , even though Parliament responded relatively quickly , this time lag is a little too long .
This is not just the fault of the Commission , but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well .
However , when it comes to safety , I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden , for example , is in principle no different from safety in Germany , Italy or Austria .
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation .
As you know , like Mr Rack , I come from a transit country , where this issue plays a particularly important role .
in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland waterway .
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy , and in particular the transport group , is magnificent .
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and , at second reading , we can accept the amendment on the proposed date , which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission , bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question .
Finally , I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport .
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission .
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster , we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety , but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances , which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem .
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur , Mr Koch .
The debate is closed .
In this respect , I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94 / 55 / EC which has been tabled for discussion today .
The amendment to the Directive on today 's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the community .
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety , but I would ask you to endorse this report .
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission 's proposal to amend the Directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road .
According to the Commission 's proposal -20º C would have been sufficient .
Mr President , with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate .
On the subject at hand , I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe 's roads , railways , and so on are as safe as possible .
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned .
If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running , it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also , as far as possible , apply to every country .
I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment .
Mr President , I would like to thank not only Mr Koch , but also the Vice - President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority .
The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously .
Mr President , I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport .
This debate and the amendment of the Directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours .
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , Mr Koch , which are contained in the various amendments , specifically four .
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination .
A major part of Wales , as you know , has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme .
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures .
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects .
Finally , we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent .
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent .
Mr President , our committee views these issues very differently and , to start , I will speak from the point of view of research .
We see it as a very positive sign that , in her own conclusions , the rapporteur has taken account of our committee 's proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts .
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood .
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this , so on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I would draw the Commission 's attention to this issue .
I would like to draw people 's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion .
In her report , Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking , yet desperately needed .
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund .
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted , as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000 - 2006 programme .
I would like to point out , however , that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us :
This , as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment , which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity , exacerbates the exodus from rural areas .
However , even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive , it is still essential , not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns , but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land , in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment .
In conclusion , I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that , for the European Union , maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives .
The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament , particularly in the face of an interim revision of these Directives .
In our amendments , we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives , so that their application should be reflected , in the best and most profitable way , by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are , when all is said and done , the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing .
If they do not , if businesspeople feel marginalised , if entrepreneurs can not take part , not only in managing but also in receiving these funds , we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly .
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business , which , by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations , but complementing them , never obstructing or excluding them , will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs .
Mr President , it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague , Mr Evans , of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status .
Let me also remind him that when his party leader , Mr Hague , was Secretary of State for Wales , he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf - Mathies regarding regulatory requirements .
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality .
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines .
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape .
The implementation and operation of the guidelines can not be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the Commission or in the civil service .
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate , while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes .
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund - users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration .
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines .
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes .
Projects have to be carried out more efficiently , more flexibly and they have to be made more productive .
Mr President , Commissioner , as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group , Elisabeth Schroedter , has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000 - 2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission 's offices for several months .
Bearing this in mind , this House should , in any event , demand that , before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved , they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament , specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today .
We are obliged to participate in drafting Directives and also in assessing their results .
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator .
We will have to study several indicators , which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others , and how they are evolving .
I do not think , however , that this report has come too late .
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for .
Mr President , I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000 - 2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following :
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries , mainly through the upgrading of roads , water treatment and related transport networks .
Key EU programmes between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe .
In conclusion , while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund , we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society .
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament 's position .
They are particularly beneficial to the Member States , and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development , job creation and , more particularly , on equal opportunities and transport issues .
Commissioner , we shall continue to raise the issue , as Article 158 , paragraph 1 , of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands .
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes .
I know many have already done so , but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides , and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today .
I share the regrets she expressed , namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines , since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I can not see this report having any sort of immediate effect , which in my view is a pity .
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will , of course , have a considerable impact , both in budgetary and geographical terms .
Finally , in this time of natural disasters , I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds .
Europe should not be completely absent , as the states tend to want .
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear .
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds .
Over the coming years , faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement , Europe will , more than ever before , require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy .
To this end , Europe as a whole , and each Member State individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities , including the Structural Funds .
For this to be possible , what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions , but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States .
For example , in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds , mainly because of excessive bureaucracy , insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level .

Directive 2005 / 32 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2005 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy - using products and amending Council Directive 92 / 42 / EEC and Directives 96 / 57 / EC and 2000 / 55 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council .
They also have a number of other important environmental impacts .
( 3 ) The ecodesign of products is a crucial factor in the Community strategy on Integrated Product Policy .
As a preventive approach , designed to optimise the environmental performance of products , while maintaining their functional qualities , it provides genuine new opportunities for manufacturers , for consumers and for society as a whole .
( 4 ) Energy efficiency improvement - with one of the available options being more efficient end use of electricity - is regarded as contributing substantially to the achievement of greenhouse gas emission targets in the Community .
Climate change is one of the priorities of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme , laid down by Decision No 1600 / 2002 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [ 3 ] .
( 8 ) This Directive seeks to achieve a high level of protection for the environment by reducing the potential environmental impact of EUPs , which will ultimately be beneficial to consumers and other end - users .
( 10 ) In order to maximise the environmental benefits from improved design it may be necessary to inform consumers about the environmental characteristics and performance of EUPs and to advise them about how to use products in a manner which is environmentally friendly .
Given the urgent need to contribute to the achievement of the commitments in the framework of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) , and without prejudice to the integrated approach promoted in this Directive , some priority should be given to those measures with a high potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions at low cost .
( 15 ) While the best - performing products or technologies available on the market , including on international markets , should be taken as reference , the level of ecodesign requirements should be established on the basis of technical , economic and environmental analysis .
Such consultation may highlight the need for a phased introduction or transitional measures .
The introduction of interim targets increases the predictability of the policy , allows for accommodating product development cycles and facilitates long term planning for interested parties .
( 18 ) For the assessment of voluntary agreements or other self-regulation measures presented as alternatives to implementing measures , information on at least the following issues should be available :
openness of participation , added value , representativeness , quantified and staged objectives , involvement of civil society , monitoring and reporting , cost-effectiveness of administering a self-regulatory initiative , sustainability .
Such integration could be facilitated by wide availability of and easy access to information relating to the sustainability of their products .
( 21 ) EUPs complying with the ecodesign requirements laid down in implementing measures to this Directive should bear the " CE " marking and associated information , in order to enable them to be placed on the internal market and move freely .
The rigorous enforcement of implementing measures is necessary to reduce the environmental impact of regulated EUPs and to ensure fair competition .
( 22 ) When preparing implementing measures and its working plan the Commission should consult Member States ' representatives as well as interested parties concerned with the product group , such as industry , including SMEs and craft industry , trade unions , traders , retailers , importers , environmental protection groups and consumer organisations .
( 25 ) Surveillance authorities should exchange information on the measures envisaged within the scope of this Directive with a view to improving surveillance of the market .
The accumulation and dissemination of the body of knowledge generated by the ecodesign efforts of manufacturers is one of the crucial benefits of this Directive .
( 26 ) A competent body is usually a public or private body , designated by the public authorities , and presenting the necessary guarantees for impartiality and availability of technical expertise for carrying out verification of the product with regard to its compliance with the applicable implementing measures .
( 27 ) Noting the importance of avoiding non - compliance , Member States should ensure that the necessary means are available for effective market surveillance .
( 28 ) In respect of training and information on ecodesign for SMEs , it may be appropriate to consider accompanying activities .
Once the reference to such a standard has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union , compliance with it should raise a presumption of conformity with the corresponding requirements set out in the implementing measure adopted on the basis of this Directive , although other means of demonstrating such conformity should be permitted .
( 30 ) One of the main roles of harmonised standards should be to help manufacturers in applying the implementing measures adopted under this Directive .
These standards should clearly indicate the relationship between their clauses and the requirements dealt with .
( 33 ) This Directive is complementary to existing Community instruments such as Council Directive 92 / 75 / EEC of 22 September 1992 on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by household appliances , Regulation ( EC ) No 1980 / 2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco - label award scheme , Regulation ( EC ) No 2422 / 2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on a Community energy efficiency labelling programme for office equipment , Directive 2002 / 96 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment ( WEEE ) , Directive 2002 / 95 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment and Council Directive 76 / 769 / EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws , regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations .
( 35 ) Directive 92 / 42 / EEC provides for a star rating system intended to ascertain the energy performance of boilers .
Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION amending and extending Council Decision of 17 December 2001 establishing an exchange , assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting ( the " Pericles " programme ) .
Pericles , the Community programme for exchange , assistance and training in the protection of the euro against counterfeiting , was established by Council Decision of 17 December 2001 ( 2001 / 923 / EC ) and is designed to support and supplement the measures undertaken by the Member States and in existing programmes to protect the euro against counterfeiting .
Article 1 of the Pericles Decision provides that the programme shall run from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2005 .
- a report , independent from the programme manager , evaluating the relevance , the efficiency and the effectiveness of the programme ;
- a communication on whether this programme should be continued and adapted , accompanied by an appropriate proposal .
The evaluation report of the Pericles Programme was submitted on 30 November 2004 .
Since early Summer 2003 , the number of counterfeit euro banknotes detected in circulation has stabilised at about 50000 a month , a level below the pre - euro levels , lower than the US dollar and extremely low compared to the nine billion genuine euro banknotes in circulation .
With a view to ensuring the clear structure in the fight against currency counterfeiting as well as close cooperation and efficient flow of information National Central Offices ( NCO ) were established in all Member States .
The Pericles programme is playing a significant role in achieving the present results in the protection of the euro and the fight against the crime of counterfeiting , through the exchange of information and the development of cooperation .
Based on questionnaires to organisers and participants , as well as discussions with stake holders , he reached the following main conclusions [ 6 ] :
- With regard to the range of information exchanges and methodologies / measures , most have been presented in the various workshops , meetings and seminars .
attendance by commercial banking sector , specialist lawyers or chambers of commerce was not sufficient .
- The activities examined were considered relevant to and among the main objectives of the programme .
A second evaluation should take place after four years .
- The programme should continue to be available to all Member States but a priority should be given ( in the first instance ) to those with low participation or who did not organise actions in the first programme , as well as the new Member States .
There should be a prioritisation in favour of staff exchanges and specific training , including case studies .
These activities are also more cost efficient .
Based on these statistics / forecasts , the overall level of commitments during the period 2002 - 2005 will reach 80 % of the initial reference amount .
In the course of the first three years of the programme 38 projects were initiated ;
Most of the actions carried out are conferences , seminars and workshops , as well as specialised training courses .
The analysis of Pericles by type of project is shown in Table 3 .
In earlier periods the large majority of participants were law enforcement agents , reflecting the priority to establish closer professional ties for a more efficient fight against euro counterfeiting .
In that respect , the evaluation report ( p. 10 and 11 ) shows that , until March 2004 , 65 % of participants were mainly from law enforcement agencies .
As of 2005 , the new Member States became active in organising Pericles actions .
However , a number of actions have been organised in third or candidate countries , reflecting the specific needs to protect the euro .
Such is the case with actions undertaken in Colombia , for all South American countries and Bulgaria , also including other South - Eastern European countries .
As a result , the transnationality and multidisciplinarity required under Article 3 of the Pericles Decision have been respected , with the latter pursued both at the level of professional background of the participants and in terms of the content of the actions .
In line with Article 5 of the Pericles Decision , the programme is implemented and coordinated by the Commission and the Member States working closely together .
This is in also line with Recital ( 7 ) of the Pericles Decision .
A small number of actions geared on the protection against currency counterfeiting are carried out under other Community programmes , such as TAIEX and Twinning .
Such actions are mainly single - country or single - subject actions ( i.e. not eligible under Pericles ) and are systematically coordinated with Pericles by the competent service in the Commission in coordination with Member States .
two Pericles seminars assisted the ( then ) acceding countries in their efforts to apply the acquis in the specific area ;
a code of conduct was drawn with respect to press and communication issues ;
The proposed period for extension is six years and the reference amount unchanged at one million euro per year .
The adaptations proposed concern the increase of the proportion of co-financing by the Community budget ;
the introduction of flexibility in the number of applications by each Member State and consequent coordination ;
and the extension of the content of the technical and operational back - up to administrative support for active investigations , with intermediation by Europol .
- continue vigilance in order to maintain or reduce the current level of euro banknote counterfeiting and avoid any increase in euro coin counterfeiting that would undermine the confidence of the public ;
- train / inform new staff and extend the training to sectors that have less benefited from the Pericles programme , namely financial agents , prosecutors and technical staff ;

It can be a very complicated thing , the ocean .
And it can be a very complicated thing , what human health is .
And I 'm going to start with this one :
We 've experienced that .
This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932 .
They say , " You know what you smell ? " .
We made the ocean unhappy ;
The pyramid of ocean life .
We see the base of the food chain , the plankton , the small things , and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid , and on so up this diagram .
Now why does that matter for human health ?
We do not really have to play it ;
There 's no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts .
They accumulate into the top of it .
The dolphins eat the fish that have PCBs from the plankton , and those PCBs , being fat-soluble , accumulate in these dolphins .
Here 's a diagram of the PCB load of dolphins in Sarasota Bay .
Those females , they 're not trying to .
The death rate in these dolphins , for the first calf born of every female dolphin , is 60 to 80 percent .
There 's another top predator in the ocean , it turns out .
That top predator , of course , is us .
In fact , what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into Tokyo and use it to genetically test the DNA out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were .
And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat .
Some of them were illegal whale meat , by the way .
That 's another story .
And those dolphin parts had a huge load of PCBs , dioxins and heavy metals .
I think that vote is occurring right now .
The mycelium infuses all landscapes , it holds soils together , it 's extremely tenacious .
They 're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature - the soil magicians .
They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth .
I 'm in love with the old - growth forest , and I 'm a patriotic American because we have those .
We share in common the same pathogens .
Fungi do not like to rot from bacteria , and so our best antibiotics come from fungi .
My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium .
This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey .
And notice that as the mycelium grows , it conquers territory and then it begins the net .
It inhales oxygen , just like we do .
But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs .
And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes .
And in these cavities , these micro - cavities form , and as they fuse soils , they absorb water .
These are little wells .
I first proposed , in the early 1990 s , that mycelium is Earth 's natural Internet .
When you walk across landscapes , it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris .
And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe .
They came to land 1.3 billion years ago , and plants followed several hundred million years later .
How is that possible ?
Makes the rocks crumble , and the first step in the generation of soil .
This was first discovered in 1859 .
It was called Prototaxites .
And these existed for tens of millions of years .
Sunlight was cut off , and fungi inherited the Earth .
at least in my own mind .
2,200 acres in size , 2,000 years old .
We were involved with several experiments .

Meanwhile , the European Union and China are pressing to close their own deals in Asia and elsewhere .
Over the last two years , India has invalidated or otherwise attacked patents on 15 drugs produced by international firms in order to make way for local champions , claiming that exclusivity enables companies to charge high prices that harm consumers .
Hosting a huge financial center , with outsize domestic banks , can be costly to taxpayers .
When civilians launched a suicidal attack on an armed force in Kyiv on February 20 , their sense of representing " the nation " far outweighed their concern with their individual mortality .
That is why the EU was hopelessly outmaneuvered by Russia in the negotiations with Ukraine over an Association Agreement .
True to form , the EU under German leadership offered far too little and demanded far too much from Ukraine .
Now , after the Ukrainian people 's commitment to closer ties with Europe fueled a successful popular insurrection , the EU , along with the International Monetary Fund , is putting together a multibillion - dollar rescue package to save the country from financial collapse .
Ukraine , with its high - quality human capital and diversified economy , is a potentially attractive investment destination .
it must have good relations with both sides .
Instead , lower growth rates are the natural result of the long - awaited rebalancing of the Chinese economy .
China 's export - led growth miracle would not have started in the 1980 ' s without the American consumer .
For a growth - starved US economy , the transformation of its codependent partner could well be a fork in the road .
In the developing world , too , the vast majority of people have started to experience sustained improvement in living standards and are rapidly developing similar growth expectations .
So far , every prediction in the modern era that mankind 's lot will worsen , from Thomas Malthus to Karl Marx , has turned out to be spectacularly wrong .
Living standards around the world continue to rise .
Leaving aside potential geopolitical disruptions , there are some formidable challenges to overcome , mostly stemming from political underperformance and dysfunction .
The first set of issues includes slow - burn problems involving externalities , the leading example being environmental degradation .
Capitalist economies have been spectacularly efficient at enabling growing consumption of private goods , at least over the long run .
Moreover , if an innovation , such as ATMs in banking , leads to increased unemployment , none of the social cost – neither the suffering of those who are laid off nor the increased fiscal cost of paying them unemployment benefits – is reflected in firms ' profitability .
A lot of intellectual effort has been devoted to devising better ways of maximizing advertising and marketing budgets – targeting customers , especially the affluent , who might actually buy the product .
It is telling that most of the symposium 's 47 participants – influential public - and private - sector figures from around the world – were unaware of the extent to which a mother 's nutrition affects her offspring 's wellbeing .
In fact , upon hearing the evidence , a former Pakistani prime minister confessed that he would have been more proactive in this area had he known while he was in office what he knows now .
After all , if an adequately nourished mother provides critical health benefits to her offspring throughout their lives , women can be viewed as the custodians of future generations ' health .
The good news is that there are solutions .
In Brazil , a television program on the role that folic - acid supplementation could play in the prevention of spina bifida ( a congenital neural tube defect ) immediately grabbed politicians ' attention .
The problem is that the rate drops sharply from 71 % to 57 % among women in their 30 ' s , as inflexible working environments and a lack of affordable childcare undermine their ability to continue investing in their careers .
The good news is that Park 's government is working to change this .
But , given that South Korea 's workforce already includes a substantial share of non - regular workers , increasing temporary employment may not contribute to economic growth .
Closing Africa 's Agricultural Gender Gap .
SEATTLE – Africa 's GDP is now growing faster than any other continent 's .
To help us better understand the problem , the World Bank and the ONE Campaign recently conducted an unprecedented analysis of the challenges facing women farmers .
Their report highlights one stark fact from the start :
But we now know that the story is much more complicated .
WASHINGTON , DC – The International Monetary Fund is an immensely useful organization , able to deliver substantial amounts of financial and technical assistance at short notice to almost any place in the world .
But in the halls of the US Congress , few people pay any attention .
In the highly charged partisan atmosphere of Washington , DC , this is without question almost always an advantage .
The reality is that it stands for and operationalizes US power , in cooperation with America 's closest allies .
( For the technical details , I recommend a recent paper by Edwin M. Truman , my colleague at the Peterson Institute for International Economics . )
Next month , Ukraine 's citizens will freely choose a new President – the best rebuke possible to Russian propaganda about our supposed failure to uphold democracy .
But the wellbeing of Ukrainian democracy is not what Putin has in mind ;
Putin 's factotums claim that Ukraine 's Russian speakers are under threat , but they can not point to a single example of persecution that might bear this out .
STANFORD – Mosquito - borne diseases kill millions of people annually , and cause suffering for many more .
As a result , research and development in genetic engineering is more expensive , discouraging investment and hampering innovation .
Over the last two decades , every effort to discipline the EU 's fiscal delinquents has failed , owing to the lack of enforcement authority .
But the depth and persistence of the ongoing crisis have exposed the euro 's fundamental fragilities , and should serve as a warning that today 's technocratic Band - Aids may not hold in the face of another shock .
Honoré De Balzac was born into a family which had struggled nobly to achieve respectability .
She was not in love with her husband .
Balzac worked these scenes from his boyhood - as he did many aspects of his life and the lives of those around him - into La Comédie Humaine .
" He devoured books of every kind , feeding indiscriminately on religious works , history and literature , philosophy and physics .
In 1814 the Balzac family moved to Paris , and Honoré was sent to private tutors and schools for the next two and a half years .
In 1816 Balzac entered the Sorbonne , where he studied under three famous professors .
And - most influential of all - Victor Cousin 's courses on philosophy encouraged his students to think independently .
Once his studies were completed , Balzac was persuaded by his father to follow him into the law ;
" He announced his intention to be a writer .
When he finished , Balzac went to Villeparisis and read the entire work to his family ;
they were unimpressed .
In Saintsbury 's view , " They are curiously , interestingly , almost enthrallingly bad .
In the preface to La Comédie Humaine he wrote :
He gave the businesses to a friend ( who made them successful ) but carried the debts for many years .
It resurfaced painfully later when - as a renowned and busy author - he traveled to Sardinia in the hopes of reprocessing the slag from the Roman mines in that country .
" The aristocracy and authority of talent are more substantial than the aristocracy of names and material power " , he wrote in 1830 .
The timing of the decision was also significant ;
1831 saw the success of La Peau De Chagrin ( The Wild Ass 's Skin or The Magic skin ) , a fable - like tale about a despondent young man named Raphaël De Valentin who finds an animal skin which promises great power and wealth .
" The magazine failed , but in July 1840 he founded another publication , the Revue Parisienne .
He is trapped by the Abbé Herrera ( Vautrin ) in a convoluted and disastrous plan to regain social status .
His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon , then sleep until midnight .
For example , Balzac 's friend Hyacinthe De Latouche had knowledge of hanging wallpaper .
Balzac was a highly conservative Royalist ;
Gustave Flaubert was also substantially influenced by Balzac .
" I have learned more [ from Balzac ] than from all the professional historians , economists and statisticians put together .
His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright .
Susanna , and twins Hamnet and Judith .
In 1623 , John Heminges and Henry Condell , two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare , published the First Folio , a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare 's .
William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare , an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield , and Mary Arden , the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer .
Although no attendance records for the period survive , most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King 's New School in Stratford , a free school chartered in 1553 , about a quarter - mile from his home .
John Shakespeare 's house , believed to be Shakespeare 's birthplace , in Stratford - upon - Avon .
The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582 .
Twins , son Hamnet and daughter Judith , followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585 .
John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster .
By 1598 , his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages .
In 1610 , John Davies of Hereford wrote that " good Will " played " kingly " roles .
and from November 1614 he was in London for several weeks with his son - in - law , John Hall .
After 1610 , Shakespeare wrote fewer plays , and none are attributed to him after 1613 .
The terms instructed that she pass it down intact to " the first son of her body " .
Shakespeare 's early classical and Italianate comedies , containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences , give way in the Mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his greatest comedies .
The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing , the charming rural setting of As You Like It , and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare 's sequence of great comedies .
Many critics believe that Shakespeare 's greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art .
On 29 June , however , a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground , an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision .
Many of the plays had already appeared in quarto versions — flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves .
A third narrative poem , A Lover 's Complaint , in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor , was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609 .
No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style .
Shakespeare 's standard poetic form was blank verse , composed in iambic pentameter .
Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse , he began to interrupt and vary its flow .
For several decades , Rymer 's view held sway ;
The Expressionists in Germany and the Futurists in Moscow mounted productions of his plays .
Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon , Christopher Marlowe , and Edward De Vere , 17 th earl of Oxford .
The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by John Shakespeare , found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street .
The document is now lost , however , and scholars differ as to its authenticity .
In 1591 the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church " for fear of process for debt " , a common Catholic excuse .
No written contemporary description of Shakespeare 's physical appearance survives , and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait , so the Droeshout engraving , which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness , and his Stratford monument provide the best evidence of his appearance .
